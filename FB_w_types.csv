I intend to do everything that I can to prevent United Technologies from shutting down their plants and throwing 2,100 workers out on the street and moving abroad where they will pay workers $3 an hour.

This is a company that in 2014 provided its retired CEO, Louis Schenevert, with a golden parachute of $172 million Â including a pension worth $31 million. And they apparently got rid of him because he was doing a bad job! Imagine what they would have given him if he was doing a good job.

This is a company that could afford to pay its new CEO more than $14 million in total compensation last year.

This is a company which made a profit of more than $7 billion last year.

This is a company that received $6 billion in defense contracts last year from the taxpayers of this country.

This is a company that in 2009 received $121 million in federal tax credits designed specifically to keep green manufacturing jobs in the United States.

And this is a company that has received more than $58 million in corporate welfare from the Export-Import Bank. That is unacceptable.

The greed of United Technologies is almost unbelievable. You canÂt make this stuff up. They have no shame.

Today, we need to send a very loud and very clear message to the CEO of United Technologies: Stop the greed. Stop destroying the middle class in America. Respect your workers. Respect the American people.

Now some people say that we have a steep hill to climb, and that is absolutely true. But together we have been climbing that steep hill from day one of our campaign. And let me be clear as I can be: we are in until the last ballot is cast.

This is the beginning of the final push to win California. But we are going to fight for every last vote, because every delegate we win is a statement of public support for the values we share.

Go to my website at Vote.Berniesanders.com and make sure you have the right information to vote for our political revolution. 

I come from the working class of this country, and I will be damned if we allow the Republican Party, who represent the rich and powerful, to win the votes of working class Americans.

It is my belief that the candidate best prepared to stop Donald Trump from winning the White House is the candidate who supports a $15 federal minimum wage, who stands on picket lines with striking workers, and who will fight to take our democracy back from the billionaire class.

I support Jim Webb's run for the presidency, and here's why.
 
When Mr. Webb was Secretary of the U.S. Navy, a Navy Reserve friend of mine died while on temporary active duty. My friend had served in Vietnam and had been a dedicated Naval officer. His family wanted him buried at Arlington Cemetery but apparently he didn't meet the eligibility criteria. So the family asked for an honor guard at the funeral in Alexandria, Va. The Navy initially said yes but the day before the funeral, the Navy called the family to advise that the honor guards were over-committed and would not be able to make it to the funeral. My friend's brother went through the phone directory that night, found Mr. Webb listed (which I find amazing), called him about 10 p.m. and explained the situation. The next morning there was an honor guard at the funeral.

The honor guard story reflects Mr. Webb's do-the-right-thing and get-the-job-done approach to dealing with issues. He's a straight shooter and made of presidential timber. I encourage all to check out his impressive biography and well thought-out positions on the issues at www.webb2016.com.

This is often dangerous, thankless work.  At the same time it is clear that prison administration is in dire need of greater training and skill methods to address the needs of those who are mentally ill.  

I don't like to categorize, but we can put the entire population into two groups: Those who think the criminal-justice system desperately needs to be fixed, and those who havenÂt been paying attention. Hopefully, through highlighting the tragic loss of Ms. Sandra Bland, the first group will grow. 

We must face the fact our prison systems are becoming warehouses for the mentally ill, without providing adequate training for those who are required to administer the systems.

Despite improvements in many systems nationwide, America's criminal justice system has deteriorated to the point that it is a national disgrace. Its irregularities and inequities cut against the notion that we are a nation of fundamental fairness.

Ms. Bland's death while in custody is another example of why reform of our entire criminal justice system must be a top priority for the next administration. I am speaking of reform from the point of apprehension all the way through how we release people from prison.

This is a tragedy that appears to have started wrongly. It could and should have been prevented by law enforcement from the very start.

I have been working for nine years to lead a major, nationwide recalculation of who goes to prison and for how long and of how we address the long-term consequences of incarceration.

Nationwide, our prison facilities are too often overcrowded, ill-managed places of violence, physical abuse, and hate, making them breeding grounds that perpetuate and magnify the same types of behavior we purport to fear. That should not be the case.

We need to understand our justice system is all too often locking up the wrong people and not locking up the right people in many cases. We are not protecting our citizens from the increasing danger of criminals who perpetrate violence and intimidation as a way of life, and we are locking up too many people who do not belong in jail.

It is incumbent on our national leadership to find a way to fix our prison system. I believe that American ingenuity can discover better ways to deal with the problems of drugs and nonviolent criminal behavior while still minimizing violent crime. 

We all deserve to live in a country made better by such changes. http://bit.ly/WebbCJR",Strategic Message,Advocacy,Issue

Today we celebrate the 50 million Americans who have been empowered through the ADA, but we also honor the many who fought passionately to make this a reality.

The nation was awoken to the reality on March 12, 1990, when dozens climbed out of their wheelchairs at the base of Capitol Hill, dropped down on their hands and knees, and began pulling themselves slowly up the 83 steps toward the Capitol building's west entrance. That day no one could ignore the barriers they faced. Eight-year-old Jennifer Keelan from Denver climbed step-by-step despite cerebral palsy.

""I'll take all night if I have to!"" she yelled.

Every American deserves equal access, equal opportunity to live high-quality lives -- to pursue the American dream. Opportunity, fairness, and security. ThatÂs what I call the American Trifecta. The ADA has been an important part of that for a quarter of a century and must remain strong.

Tragically, our government treated these men and women irresponsibly, at times, over the course of these wars. While in the U.S. Senate in 2007, I offered an amendment to the annual defense policy bill, fighting to require troops spend as much time at home as they do deployed. At that time, active-duty soldiers were supposed to get 12 months at home after a 15-month tour overseas. That was not enough, and even that was not always allowed.

As a Vietnam War veteran, former Navy secretary and the father of a Marine who fought in Iraq, I knew they needed longer. I saw it as my duty then to urge Congress to impose restrictions on troop deployments to give soldiers and Marines more time to recuperate and train at home.

My amendment received 56 votes, but 46 Republican senators used parliamentary rules to block it.

Many of our ground forces were actually spending more time in Iraq than they were at home. Our troops were four years into an occupation. They needed us. They were fatigued.

Fellow presidential candidate Lindsey Graham was among those leading opposition to the amendment. He was wrong then and he is wrong now as he promises to send American troops back to Iraq if heÂs elected.

There was not a strategic justification for that opposition. And our men and women are paying for it now.

""Iowa friends, this message is for you!

Lots of people ask me why IÂm working so hard to elect Hillary Clinton our next president (and the first female president of the United States). And I tell them itÂs for people like my mom, who was a teacher in St. Louis for 36 years. I was raised by strong women, and Hillary reminds me of my momÂtheyÂre both fighters. And please believe me when I say there is no one who fights harder for American families than Hillary.

And if you want someone whoÂs going to stand up to Republicans to defend the progress that weÂve made under President ObamaÂand whoÂs gonna fight for people like my mom and yoursÂthen IÂm asking you to caucus for Hillary on Monday night. LetÂs do this!

""Hey, New Hampshire friend/long-lost cousin/college roommate I havenÂt spoken to in foreverÂ

I know youÂre planning to vote tomorrow, right?!

And if youÂre still making up your mind about who to vote for, I hope youÂll check out Hillary ClintonÂs positions and see where she stands. I know youÂve always been concerned about college affordabilityÂdid you know Hillary has a smart, detailed plan for that? ItÂs one of the reasons IÂm working so hard to elect her. You can check it out at hillaryclinton.com.

No matter who you vote for, make sure you vote! You can find your polling place here.

Remember: If you make abortion a crime, you make women who seek abortions criminals. You put one in three women at risk. Women, especially low-income women and women of color, are already being punished by GOP-led efforts to stigmatize and restrict health care. Every womanÂregardless of income or zip codeÂdeserves access to health care. If you don't get that, you have no business being president.

The best way to help Louisianans affected by these terrible floods is to make sure they have the resources they need today. I am committed to visiting communities affected by these floods, at a time when the presence of a political campaign will not disrupt the response, to discuss how we can and will rebuild together.

When an allergic reaction leads to anaphylactic shock, a shot of epinephrine can literally be the difference between life and death. But now, just as parents are about to send kids with severe food and insect allergies back to school, the EpiPen's manufacturer is hiking its price to an all-time high.

Over the last several years, Mylan Pharmaceuticals has increased the price of EpiPens by more than 400%. They're now charging up to $600 for a two-EpiPen set that must be replaced every 12-18 months. This both increases out-of-pocket costs for families and first responders, and contributes to higher premiums for all Americans and their employers.

That's outrageous -- and it's just the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers. I believe that our pharmaceutical and biotech industries can be an incredible source of American innovation, giving us revolutionary treatments for debilitating diseases. But it's wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them.

That's why IÂve put forward a plan, hrc.io/2c7gjuI, to address exorbitant drug price hikes like these. As part of my plan, IÂve made clear that pharmaceutical manufacturers should be required to explain significant price increases, and prove that any additional costs are linked to additional patient benefits and better value.  Since there is no apparent justification in this case, I am calling on Mylan to immediately reduce the price of EpiPens. 

In addition, when it comes to treatments like delivering epinephrine that have been available for decades, my plan encourages the production of alternative products. That's how we can harness the power of competition to keep drug prices at a level that all Americans can afford.",Call to Action,,

Cuando una reacciÃ³n alÃ©rgica lleva a un shock anafilÃ¡ctico, una inyecciÃ³n de epinefrina puede ser la diferencia entre la vida y la muerte. Pero ahora, cuando los padres estÃ¡n por mandar a la escuela a hijos con severas alergias alimentarias o a insectos, el fabricante de EpiPen estÃ¡ subiendo su precio a un nÃºmero sin precedente.

A lo largo de los Ãºltimos aÃ±os, Mylan Pharmaceuticals ha incrementado el precio de los EpiPens mÃ¡s del 400%. Ahora estÃ¡n cobrando hasta $600 por un set de dos EpiPens que tiene que ser reemplazado cada 12-18 meses. Esto no solo aumenta los costos de bolsillo de las familias y de los primeros intervinientes sino que tambiÃ©n contribuye a un aumento de las primas para todos los estadounidenses y sus empleadores.

Esto es indignanteÂy es solamente el Ãºltimo ejemplo preocupante de una empresa que se aprovecha de sus consumidores. Yo creo que nuestras industrias farmacÃ©utica y de biotecnologÃ­a pueden ser una gran fuente de innovaciÃ³n estadounidense, otorgando tratamientos revolucionarios para enfermedades debilitadoras. Pero estÃ¡ mal cuando las empresas farmacÃ©uticas ponen a sus ganancias antes que a sus pacientes, aumentando los precios sin justificar el valor detrÃ¡s de ellos.

Es por esto que hemos creado un plan, hrc.io/2c7gjuI, para resolver los aumentos exorbitantes en los precios de medicamentos como estos. Como parte de mi plan, he dejado en claro que las compaÃ±Ã­as farmacÃ©uticas deberÃ­an tener que explicar aumentos de precios significativos y demostrar que todos los costos adicionales estÃ¡n relacionados con beneficios adicionales para los pacientes y mejor calidad. Como no hay una justificaciÃ³n evidente en este caso, le pido a Mylan que reduzca inmediatamente el precio de los EpiPens.

Adicionalmente, cuando se trata de tratamientos como suministrar epinefrina que ha estado disponible por dÃ©cadas, mi plan fomenta la producciÃ³n de productos alternativos. AsÃ­ es cÃ³mo podemos aprovechar el poder de la competencia para mantener los precios de los medicamentos a niveles a los que todos los estadounidenses puedan acceder.",Not English,,

Trump kicked off his evening by lying to the American people about his position on the Iraq WarÂand no one stopped to call him on it. Not only did the moderator, Matt Lauer, fail to fact-check TrumpÂhe then kept the conversation moving.

The worst part is, there's nothing new about this happening. We all know that Trump lies a lot. And we all know that many outlets in the press apparently lack the wherewithal to call him outÂand help voters understand that what they're hearing from Trump isn't just normal political talk, but an unprecedented descent into unqualified nonsense from a major-party presidential nominee.

At this point, we should understand that we just can't sit around and wait for fact checkers in the media to keep Trump honest. We have to step up and do it ourselves. No one will do it for us. And the outcome of the election could hang in the balance.

That means we have to work even harder to get the facts out there on TV, online, and in conversations with voters across the country. We have to speak so loudly that every voter in America hears us. And we have to recommit ourselves to delivering Trump a definitive rebuke on November 8. Chip in now to help make sure we do: hrc.io/2czTBbD",Call to Action,,

The contrast couldn't be starker: Tim will lay out his and Hillary's vision for our country that says we're stronger when we work together and help all Americans get ahead, while Pence will take the stage as the running mate to the most divisive, unqualified candidate in history.

Throughout this campaign, Donald Trump has spouted hateful, nonsensical policy ideas and used unhinged rhetoric unfit for a Commander-in-Chief. He's called immigrants """"rapists"""" and ""criminals,"" proposed a ban on Muslims entering the country, demeaned women and said they should be punished for getting an abortion, insulted our veterans, and the list goes on.

And the scary thing is, Mike Pence has actually implemented a lot of the dangerous ideas Trump supports in Congress and as governor of IndianaÂfrom defunding Planned Parenthood and all but eliminating access to safe and legal abortion, to codifying discrimination against LGBT people and outlawing higher minimum wages.

So tonight, Pence faces a choice: Will he fall on his sword to defend Trump's indefensible and offensive policies and statements, or will he hang his running mate out to dry? Will he ignore the facts and back up TrumpÂs lies, or will he acknowledge the truth on some of TrumpÂs biggest falsehoods?

Tim believes tonight's debate should be about the issues facing American families because that's what he's been fighting for his whole life. If you agree, chip in now to let him know you've got his back: hrc.io/2dct7LZ",Strategic Message,Attack,Image

""By now, you've probably heard some news about a bewildering letter sent to Congressional leaders by the Director of the FBI. This is all a bit confusing, and much of the reporting has been misleading or downright inaccurate, so I want to take a minute to walk through this. 

Here's the quick backstory: In July, FBI Director Jim Comey concluded a year-long investigation by deciding not to go forward with any case about Hillary's emails. It wasn't even a close call, he said. In his words, 'no reasonable prosecutor' would have brought charges.

Yesterday, in a surprise to us all, Comey wrote a very strange letter to Congress that was long on innuendo and short on facts. He said that in a completely separate investigation, the FBI had found some emails that may or may not be related to Hillary, and indeed may or may not be significant at all.

It's being reported that Comey sent this letter over the objections of Department of Justice officials who told him that it was inconsistent with longstanding policy of both Democratic and Republican administrations not to take action that might impact an election. It's an unprecedented intrusion into a close presidential election with less than 11 days until Election Day.
 
Voters deserve answers.

Comey needs to come clean with the American people about what he found and answer all the questions about why he took this unprecedented step less than weeks before the election.

Here's what this changes for you and this campaign: Absolutely nothing.

The facts be damnedÂTrump's always shown a complete disregard for the truth. In spite of there being no new information, he's already raising money off the bizarre letter (he literally sent a text message asking for money within an hour of the story breaking!) and he's more fired up than ever on the trail today.

These are the actions of a desperate man. Trump knows he can't win on his character, temperament, or his policies. He's behind, so he'll cling to whatever he can. We can't let him get away with this.

Our organizers and volunteers on the ground are rallying behind Hillary in what will be the biggest volunteer weekend of the campaign so far. You need to have her back, too. You need to say you're not willing to let Trump bully or buy his way into the presidency, and you're not going to let anything stop us from making history.

There are ten days to go. Let's buckle down, stay focused, and win this. Chip in here: hrc.io/donatenow""",Call to Action,,

""As of this morning, the Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll has us down one point. As of yesterday, Trump's odds of winning had climbed to above 1-in-4, per Nate Silver's projections. And he seems to be making up ground in Florida, according to a whole slew of polls. The truth is that Trump has a real, viable path to 270 electoral votes.

We have a very small window of time left to try to deploy resources to our battleground states that it will take to guarantee a win. So IÂm asking you: Can you be one of the people we need on Facebook to step up and chip in to our GOTV Fund today to try to make sure we prove this poll an outlier come Tuesday?

This is the most consequential election in our lifetimes. Even a dollar today shows that you're fighting for Hillary: hrc.io/2ec2HcJ

We need to give more support to students who are also parents. So, here's a new plan: We're going to create a scholarship program for student parents, called SPARKÂStudent Parents in America Raising Kids. It will give extra financial help for student parents who keep their grades up. It's not a lot of money, but it's enough to help pay for gas or a babysitterÂjust the kind of extra help that can keep somebody in school. 

We're also going to significantly increase access to quality childcare on college campuses. Childcare centers already exist on some campuses, but a lot of parents don't have any safe, affordable place to leave their kids while they go to school. 

The financial benefits of all this are clear: Students with college degrees can earn more than a half a million dollars over their lifetimes more than students with high school degrees. When a parent is able to get that education that so many parents work for, it really makes a difference. This is going to be good for kids, for students, and for parents.

Yes, I should have used two email addresses, one for personal matters and one for my work at the State Department. Not doing so was a mistake. I'm sorry about it, and I take full responsibility.

It's important for you to know a few key facts. My use of a personal email account was aboveboard and allowed under the State Department's rules. Everyone I communicated with in government was aware of it. And nothing I ever sent or received was marked classified at the time. 

As this process proceeds, I want to be as transparent as possible. That's why I've provided all of my work emails to the government to be released to the public, and why I'll be testifying in public in front of the Benghazi Committee later next month.

I know this is a complex story. I could haveÂand should haveÂdone a better job answering questions earlier. I'm grateful for your support, and I'm not taking anything for granted.

The land has a unique topography; flat, green, and fertile in the west, stretching east into the towering Sierra Maestra, where Castro and his guerrillas operated in the revolution. I was struck by how the 745-mile-long island seems lost in time. Everything I saw there was modest and humble, but not what I could call poverty-stricken. No one appeared hungry, homeless, or sick; indeed, the island has far better health care and education than many of its wealthier neighbors. But it was a strange experience to get off a modern jet at JosÃ© MartÃ­ International Airport and then share the road with horse-drawn carts on the drive into Havana. Many motorists drove fifty-year-old Soviet and American cars that ran on parts fabricated in backyard machine shops. Most buildings look as if they have not been painted since 1959, when Castro overthrew the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista and set up his own.

ÂIf it lied deliberatelyÂif the Times tried to slander the character of Senator Cruz and his publisher, knowing the charge to be falseÂthen that goes directly to the journalistic integrity of the institution. How many other lies has the Times told? Are they only directed at Republicans? Under what circumstances does the Times believe it is appropriate for journalists to deliberately deceive the public?Â

ÂIf the New York Times desires to be seen as anything other than a partisan and dishonest attack dog for the far Left, then the only responsible course of action is either to release their so-called ÂevidenceÂ or to publicly apologize for making false charges.

We are seeing a manifestation of the rhetoric and vilification of law enforcement that is coming from the top Â all the way to the President of the United States and senior administration officials.

Cops across this country are feeling the assault. TheyÂre feeling the assault from the President, from the top on down as we see, whether itÂs in Ferguson or Baltimore, the response of senior officials of the President, of the Attorney General, is to vilify law enforcement. That is fundamentally wrong, and it is endangering the safety and security of us all.

IÂm proud to stand with law enforcement, to stand with the police and fire fighters and first responders. They are American heroes. And they need a President who doesnÂt attack and vilify them and who doesnÂt seek to tear us apart along racial lines to inflame racial divisions. Instead we need a President who works to bring us together and unify us behind shared American values.

Rick Perry is a friend and a remarkable public servant. He is a proud veteran who bravely served our nation, and he was an extraordinary governor of Texas. As Texas Solicitor General, it was an honor to serve under him.

Because of his principled leadership as the longest-serving governor in the stateÂs history, Texas has become a haven for freedom, entrepreneurship, and limitless opportunity. The entire Republican field was unquestionably made stronger by the experience and wisdom he brought to the race.

In honor of his passion for our veterans, Heidi and I have today made a personal contribution to both the Lone Survivor Foundation and the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation, in honor of Rick and Anita Perry, and we encourage everyone else to do the same.Â

We wish Governor Perry, Anita, Griffin, and Sydney the very best in what is certain to be decades of continued service to our Nation.

Do you want someone who has, like Donald Trump for decades, been part of the problem in Washington by donating to politicians like Jimmy Carter, Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid, John Kerry, and Hillary Clinton to benefit him and his business dealings? Or do you want your next president to be someone who, like Ted Cruz, has spent a lifetime defending our Constitution and Bill of Rights?",Strategic Message,Attack,Image

This is why Americans have lost trust in the media.

Instead of in-depth reporting on the harvesting and trafficking of baby organs, or a judge in California who raised over $200,000 for President Obama issuing an order to censor investigative journalists from releasing even more videos, the New York Times and the Associated Press this week had hot takes on ÂFashion World Reacts to the Killing of CecilÂ and ""Here's What Betty White Thinks of Cecil the Lion's KillingÂ respectively.

A heathy democracy can only survive with a free media that keeps its citizens informed. 

The media has treated President Obama with kid gloves, allowing his administration to ignore Planned Parenthood's disgusting scheme to sell parts of aborted babies while simultaneously launching an investigation to punish the organization that exposed these atrocities.

The media can choose to not cover it. A judge can try to censor it. But the truth will come out. And WE will not not let them get away with it.

Our nominee should embody those principles. He Â or she Â must make the case for the cause of conservatism more than the cause of their own celebrity. I still believe in the power of that message Â a message that offers hope, redemption and solace in the midst of storms.
 
When I gave my life to Christ, I said, Âyour ways are greater than my ways. Your will superior to mine.Â
 
I submit that His will remains a mystery, but some things have become clear. 

That is why today I am suspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States.
 
We have a tremendous field Â the best in a generation Â so I step aside knowing our party is in good hands, and as long as we listen to the grassroots, the cause of conservatism will be too.

I'm counting on you to be one of those Patriots in my corner on Sunday.
 
The good news is, the Washington Machine's smear campaign proves you and I are winning this battle.
 
The American people are sick and tired of business as usual, and our message is resonating among Americans of all backgrounds.
 
I'm taking on the entire Washington Machine - from the White House on down on Sunday.

So please let me know I have your support by adding your name to the fight to end illegal spying.

In fact, a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows me leading Hillary Clinton by a margin of 45%-37% among independents.

The media might not understand it. The Inside the Beltway crowd in Washington, D.C. doesn't get it.

But it's a new day in American politics.

The American people don't want Big Government under EITHER party.

They want to stop the career politicians from sinking our country further in debt.

They want to stop the ObamaCare train wreck.

They want a President who will stand and FIGHT the Washington Machine -- just like I did when I filibustered for ten-and-a-half hours and stood up to President Obama's radical NSA spying schemes.

That fight was the real deal. Renewal of the so-called ""PATRIOT Act's"" worst spying provisions was supposed to be a foregone conclusion. But you and I proved we can make a difference if we stand together and fight back.

Polls show I'm leading her in key swing states like Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. 

You see, after my fight to force President Obama's illegal NSA spying to expire, more and more Americans are realizing I'm not kidding about defeating the Washington Machine.

Today, I'm announcing my Fair and Flat tax plan that I will make the centerpiece of my first term as President of the United States -- a tax plan that puts over $2 TRILLION back in Americans' pockets, creates at least 1.4 million new jobs and turbo-charges our economy in the process.

You can already hear the shrieks and howls coming from the special interest lobby in Washington, D.C. over my announcement.

For far too long, Washington, D.C. bureaucrats and Big Government politicians have believed your money is theirs -- and they can spend it better than everyday hard-working Americans and entrepreneurs.

I disagree. 

In fact, I believe if the Washington Machine's tax-and-spend policies aren't stopped, our economy will slide further down the slow-growth rut of the last decade.

That's why I'm proposing to put the Washington Machine on a much-needed diet by enacting the boldest and biggest tax cut in American history.

If passed into law, my tax plan would:

>>> End the workers tax: I will end the FICA payroll tax, the largest tax for many working Americans. It goes to zero. 

>>> Eliminate the headaches and complication in filing federal taxes by allowing every taxpayer to file a simple, one-page return with a low and fair tax rate of 14.5%, saving American families over $2 TRILLION in the first 10 years; 

>>> End corporate welfare and special tax breaks, eliminating the army of lobbyists and tax lawyers gaming the system. That means no more mom and pop small businesses paying 40% of their income in taxes, while big corporations -- armed with armies of slick lawyers -- pay zero;

>>> Provide a real economic stimulus to our economy by exploding the GDP by almost 10% over the first 10 years. 

I understand my plan is bold.

But, I'm not interested in nibbling around the edges of ""reforming"" Washington.

I'm running for President to flip Washington upside-down on its head and Defeat the Machine.

So please, sign your ""Fair and Flat Tax NOW!"" petition, and agree to chip in a contribution of $20.16 to help me put my tax plan in front of as many voters as possible in key early states: http://randpaul.com/f/tax-plan-2?sr=618fb1",Call to Action,,

This doesn't make me the most popular guy with the army of lawyers and lobbyists who game the system.

But I'm not running for their approval.

I'm in this race to take our government back. 

That's why I'm proposing a $2 trillion dollar tax cut Â the largest in American history.

My plan is simple, it's fair, and it cuts taxes for ALL Americans.

And it ends the workers tax: I will end the FICA payroll tax, the largest tax for many working Americans. 

It goes to zero.

Drive a stake through the heart of the IRS.

This won't make me popular in Washington.

The lobbyists and lawyers who game their connections to the Washington Machine are already lining up against me.

But I'm running for President to end the Big Government status-quo.

We need to pull our economy out of the ditch it has settled into under President Obama.

And that starts with my $2 trillion dollar tax cut.

It's flat. It's simple. And it's fair.

No more FICA ripping thousands of dollars each year out of Americans' paychecks.

That workers tax - the biggest tax most Americans pay - is slashed to zero. It's gone.

My plan also kicks the IRS out of your life with a simple one-page form and one tax rate.

The economy has sputtered along under President Obama's disastrous high tax policies.

By cutting taxes for all Americans and putting the federal government on a diet, my plan will grow the economy 22% faster than anything we have experienced the last 6 years.

When Ronald Reagan slashed taxes, he ignited an economic boom that carried through two decades.

He believed the money you earn is yours and you know how to spend it better than government bureaucrats.

I agree and I believe it's time our party embrace his philosophy that government is not the solution to our problems.

That's why I've proposed the biggest and boldest tax cut in American history.

But the special interest groups and their establishment pals in Congress will target me as ""Enemy #1.""

So I need to know you will stand with me.

By unleashing the American economy from the heavy hand of government, our economy will grow 22% faster than anything we've seen under President Obama.

Washington, D.C. doesn't have a ""revenue"" problem. It has a spending problem.

Just since President Obama took office, government tax revenue has hit a record-shattering $3.1 trillion. Yet the Washington Machine's spending continues to push our nation deeper in debt.

As President, I will fight to cut spending with every ounce of energy in my body, including passing a Balanced Budget Amendment.

But the best thing we can do to get out of debt and balance our budget is to put more Americans back to work. 

According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation's analysis, my plan would create at least 1.4 million new jobs -- creating new wealth and tax revenue to pay down our debt.

This is the first part of my plan to defeat the Washington Machine. And I need your help to get this plan out as quickly as possible to voters in key early states.

But this President still won't make the Trans-Pacific trade deal public, keeping it locked away in the Capitol Hill basement -- far out of the view of the American people.

Over the past few weeks, more and more Americans have begun to see why I oppose Obamatrade.

As far as I'm concerned, the American people have had enough of government hiding things from us. 

And every time they say it's ""for our own good,"" we've found ourselves in an even deeper mess.

Just think of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who stated Congress needed to pass ObamaCare ""so you can find out what's in it!""

If passed, ""fast-track"" authority would allow trade deals the Obama administration negotiates with the 12 member nations covered in the Trans-Pacific Partnership to pass Congress with a simple majority vote -- instead of the 67 U.S. Senate votes the U.S. Constitution requires for ratification of a Treaty.

I believe in free markets. I believe in free trade.

But given this President's abuse of Executive Authority -- with everything from assaults on the Second Amendment to NSA spying -- I worry Congress is preparing to put the fox in charge of the hen house.

With only a simple majority vote needed for congressional approval of trade deals the Obama administration negotiates, I'm afraid President Obama could gain all the power he needs to finish ""remaking America"" by imposing a horde of new Big Government policies.

Yet supporters of this trade deal -- who tell you and me we have nothing to worry about -- have never even read the text!

And Members of Congress are fighting to tack on ""Trade Adjustment Assistance,"" which creates a massive new welfare system here in the United States -- and dramatically hikes taxes on small businesses.

The Washington Post has already reported that the U.S. economy is ""grinding nearly to a halt!""

So massive tax hikes are the absolute LAST thing we need.

It's time for this scheme to be released for the American people. 

If the President won't release it and agree to an open and transparent process -- to ensure Americans' liberty is protected -- Congress must vote ""NO!""

Will you please agree to your most generous contribution of $20.16 or more today? https://secure.randpaul.com/?june-30&sr=627fb1a 

This is the most important FEC deadline I have faced. Ever!

The media and Big Government members of BOTH parties have seen the strong poll numbers I'm posting over the past couple of months.

But they want so badly to just dismiss my surge of momentum any way possible.

A strong fundraising quarter will help ensure they can't. 

A strong fundraising quarter will help me rally even more Americans with my strong stands to:

*** Cut taxes and spending. My 14.5% flat-rate tax plan would drive a stake through the heart of the IRS, return $2 TRILLION to the American people and create 1.4 million new jobs;

*** End the reign of career politicians by passing term limits;

*** Force Members of Congress to read the bills they vote on -- instead of springing last-minute thousand page bills on the American people that are laden with handouts to those with the best lobbyists;

*** Repeal ALL of ObamaCare. Every last word of this horrendous government takeover of our healthcare;

*** Audit the Federal Reserve;

*** Protect the entire Bill of Rights -- including the Second Amendment, our right to religious liberty, the God-given right to life and our right to privacy from government snooping.

These are the reforms that can finally destroy the Washington Machine and renew freedom and prosperity in America.

So please chip in as generously as you can today: https://secure.randpaul.com/?june-30&sr=627fb1b

The Democrats see the same polls you and I see. The same ones that show my campaign leading Hillary Clinton in key swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania.

For taking this stand, I know I'm going to be attacked like never before.

But I think it's high time someone did something!

The truth is, for years politicians in BOTH parties have promised you and me secure borders.

But all we have to show for those promises is sheer lawlessness.

This President has time and again sought to go around Congress with illegal and unconstitutional executive actions regarding immigration.

And now many American cities are following in lockstep in open defiance of federal law!

These so-called ""sanctuary cities"" prohibit the use of funds to enforce federal immigration law, usually banning officers from even asking about a person's immigration status.

These cities become magnets for illegal immigrant criminals and gang members who have been deported multiple times, but know they're safe if they can just stay within a city's borders.

This can't be allowed to stand.

Not when we know terrorist organizations are looking at our porous southern border as a way to gain entry into the United States.

Not if we are to save the concept of rule by law.

My bill would end all federal taxpayer funding for these cities until they start ENFORCING federal immigration law.

I know these cities will shriek and moan that there shouldn't be any strings attached to all of your tax dollars. 

They'll say they're entitled to pick and choose what laws they recognize.

And you can bet our national media will be on their side, and come after me with everything they have.

""We've been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I'm not gonna crush that part.""

That's a direct quote from a video released today showing Planned Parenthood's Senior Director of Medical Services describing how she performs late-term abortions to dismember and sell body parts for profit! 

This callous disrespect for human life sickens me.

Despite their best efforts, I doubt our national media will succeed in covering this story up. 

But I'm afraid that's not enough. It's time for the American people to demand Congress take action.

If you agree, I hope you'll sign your ""Stand for Life: Defund Planned Parenthood"" Petition immediately: https://randpaul.com/f/stand-for-life-petition?sr=714fb1a

Congress holds the power of the purse. So this is one measure Congress can take now -- even with President Obama in the White House.

And it's up to you and me to ensure my colleagues in Congress take action, and set the stage for a pro-life President to sign even more pro-life legislation into law once elected.

No one else will do it for us.

After all, where is the media now?

Where's the storm over this video that shows this Planned Parenthood executive bragging about performing banned partial-birth abortions and selling babies' body parts for profit?

Where are all the hard-hitting questions to pro-abortion Democrats about their support, with taxpayer dollars, for this kind of madness?

It's time for pro-lifers to take a stand. It's time to defund Planned Parenthood.

Studies show that this alone will save unborn life.

Not only that, but Members of Congress who choose to vote to keep funding Planned Parenthood will pay a severe political price in 2016, paving the way for a pro-life President to sign pro-life legislation into law.

I've cradled their small, precious bodies in the palm of one hand and looked into their eyes as they struggled to survive. Many of them weighed under two pounds.

So I'm not going to mince words. The thought of Planned Parenthood officials killing these babies, dismembering them and selling their body parts for profit sickens my stomach. 

And I vow to do everything I can to stop it. That's why I just introduced an Amendment to H.R. 22 (the vehicle for the highway bill) to Defund Planned Parenthood. 

The latest undercover video shows Planned Parenthood officials squabbling over the price of aborted baby parts because one official joked she wanted to buy a Lamborghini.

And to add insult to injury, hard-working taxpayers are being forced to fund Planned Parenthood's killing and selling of aborted baby body parts for profit.

In fact, Planned Parenthood raked in almost $550 million in taxpayer funding in 2014 alone.

That's over half a BILLION dollars! Ripped from the paychecks of hard-working taxpayers and sent directly to Planned Parenthood's abortion mills across the country.

I believe it's time to put the brakes on Planned Parenthood's taxpayer funded gravy train.

And since the Republican Congress controls the power of the purse, I believe this is a fight you and I can win -- even with President Obama in the White House.

So please sign your ""Defund Planned Parenthood"" Petition immediately: https://randpaul.com/f/stand-for-life-petition?sr=723fb1a

And after you sign your petition, won't you please chip in a contribution of $20.16 right away?

There's no telling when my Amendment to defund Planned Parenthood will come to the floor for a vote. It could be as early as next week.

Your generous gift will help me mobilize as many Republican voters across the country to stand with me in this fight to end taxpayer funding of abortion. 

So won't you please chip in a contribution of $20.16 right away to help defund Planned Parenthood?

It's up to you and me to ensure my colleagues in Congress take action. No one else will do it for us. The national media remains virtually silent.

But with your help, I'm confident we can force my Amendment to defund Planned Parenthood to the floor for an up or down vote.

A Taxpayer calculator, click below to see your share of planned parenthood costs. 

Planned Parenthood and its affiliates have received $4.3 billion in government funding over the last ten years, according to the groupÂs annual reports. Their government funding comes from both federal and state governments. We do not know exactly how much of Planned ParenthoodÂs funding comes from the federal government. Much of the funding comes from joint federal-state programs like Medicaid and the State ChildrenÂs Health Insurance Program. Also, federal agencies can award funding to a state, which in turn passes that funding on to a Planned Parenthood organization. This analysis is an estimate of an individualÂs share of Planned ParenthoodÂs government funding based solely on that individualÂs federal income tax burden category.

Either way the vote goes, it's going to be a huge loss for Planned Parenthood, as Hillary Clinton and their allies in Congress will be exposed for the true extremists that they are.

""The U.S. Senate will vote tomorrow on Senator Paul's bill to cut off the flow of your tax dollars to Planned Parenthood.

Passage or failure will hinge on just a handful of votes.

With Planned Parenthood's massive public relations campaign peppering the Washington TV and radio markets with attack ads, I'm worried that anything could happen.

That's why I'm reaching out to you, hoping that you know whatever amount you can afford to contribute right now will help decide the fate of Senator Paul's fight to defund Planned Parenthood.
https://secure.randpaul.com/?planned-parenthood&sr=802fb2

It's no secret that Planned Parenthood has deep connections in Washington.

It's shameful how politicians bend to their will while ignoring the majority of Americans who are horrified by Planned Parenthood altering the way they execute unborn babies to salvage their organs for sale.

Hillary Clinton and Planned Parenthood's allies in Congress are going to pay a severe price for defending this madness.

The American people are seeing the truth about what they're doing to unborn little boys and girls.

Senator Paul is fighting tooth-and-nail to strip Planned Parenthood of every last dime of your taxpayer dollars.

He is standing strong for his convictions and refusing to bow down -- and for that reason, I hope you'll help Senator Paul reach his $200,000 goal before tomorrow's vote.
https://secure.randpaul.com/?planned-parenthood&sr=802fb3

Our TV, radio, and Internet ads are the quickest and most effective way to whip up the grassroots firestorm needed to dial up the heat on the Senate to support Rand's bill.

Regardless of tomorrow's outcome, Planned Parenthood has lost.

There's no hiding the fact that Planned Parenthood is aborting babies, dismembering them, and selling their body parts for profit.

Now, their allies in Congress must either defend these atrocities and risk facing the wrath of an angry electorate -- or abide by the will of voters and support Rand's bill.

I believe we can WIN this vote if a grassroots uprising swarms the halls of Congress, stares down the Abortion Lobby, and sends a loud-and-clear message to every single U.S. Senator:

""You have two options: 1) vote FOR Senator Paul's Defund Planned Parenthood bill or 2) lose your seat!""

If you agree, please help crank up the heat on Congress by chipping in your most generous contribution before time runs out -- and remember, the more you give the more we can do.

The Washington Machine and its pals in the press are trying to force an establishment candidate on our party.

...One who is committed to upending the Big Government status quo.

That's why polls show me leading Hillary Clinton in must-win states like Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

The media is desperate to drown out the voices of the folks like you who actually decide elections.

So I'm ready for the funny business.

In past debates, you and I have seen how moderators make themselves the story by favoring certain candidates or lobbing up softball questions to their favored establishment candidates.

And with multiple polls showing me besting Hillary Clinton in key swing states, I'm bracing for the worst.

That's why I hope I can count on you.

If my campaign can show a burst of momentum heading into tonight's debate, it will help blunt the media's tricks.

This race is wide open.

I'm not going to mince words here.

We don't need any more politics-as-usual in Washington, D.C. Our country can't afford another Big Government establishment candidate from EITHER party.

And we certainly can't afford a candidate who has spent years supporting bailouts, corporate welfare and buying political influence.

We need a real reformer. A candidate who isn't just mouthing platitudes.

We need true leadership.

I've proven I will stand up to the Washington Machine on everything from NSA spying, to my Fair and Flat Tax plan, to defunding Planned Parenthood.

Now, I'm running for President to:

*** CUT TAXES AND SPENDING. My Fair and Flat Tax plan will blow up the tax code and start over, return $2 TRILLION to the American people over ten years, grow our GDP by a whopping 10% and result in at least 1.4 million new jobs;

*** PASS TERM LIMITS to end the reign of career politicians in Washington, D.C.;

*** FORCE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO READ THE BILLS THEY VOTE ON, and stop their habit of ramming thousand-page bills into law at the last minute before anyone knows what's in them;

-----

If you want to know what I really think about my son, Rand, then don't listen to our national media. 

Don't listen to the Big Government Washington insiders who'd love nothing more than another Bush/Clinton showdown in November of 2016. 

Let me be clear... 

There is not one candidate who has run for president in my lifetime who can say they fully share my commitment to liberty, Austrian economics, small government, and following the Constitution, than my son, Rand Paul.

That's why I have wholeheartedly endorsed him. 

And it's why I wanted to write to you today to personally urge you to sign your Pledge of Support for Rand: https://randpaul.com/f/join-ron-paul?sr=814fb1a 

I know the media likes to play this little game where they pit us, or certain views, against each other.

Don't fall for it. They're trying to manufacture storylines at liberty's expense. You've spent years seeing how the media treated me. They aren't my friends and they aren't yours. 

So please don't waste your time or risk the massive gains you and I have made over the past eight years by suddenly believing Big Government apologists in our media are some sort of truth tellers.

Remember, truth is treason in the empire of lies. And nowhere is that more true than when it comes to Washington, D.C. and their media mouthpieces.

Even where Rand and I do have minor differences of opinion, I would take Rand's position over any of his opponents' in both parties every time.

That's because he advocates diplomacy and negotiations, and opposes war. 

And Rand is the ONLY one in the race who is standing up for your Liberty, across the board.

You certainly saw a great example of that in the first debate. Chris Christie tried to trample",Call to Action,,

Rand stands ready to lead, and to win. He has my full support. I ask that he also have yours.

The truth is, Rand needs our grassroots army of liberty lovers more than ever.

The national media and the establishment of both parties would love nothing more than to drive a stake through the heart of our Liberty Movement and stop Rand at all costs.

They're going all-out to destroy him just like they tried to destroy me. And if they succeed, they'll go on to even more spending, spying, welfare and warfare in Washington, D.C.

I was able to weather the media's viciousness because I had patriots like you at my side. Because good folks like you stood with me, the Washington Machine failed. Our Liberty Movement continues to grow.

Now, my son Rand needs us in his corner. I'm answering the call. I'm proud to say I ""Stand with Rand.""

Can I count on you to join me? Will you please sign your Pledge of Support and chip in $20.16 right away? https://randpaul.com/f/join-ron-paul?sr=815fb2a

Please know every dollar is critical.

Unlike other candidates, Rand isn't depending on Wall Street fat-cats and banksters who want more special treatment, bailouts and stimulus packages to bankroll his candidacy. 

He's depending on patriots like you who are willing to fight to take our country back.

All the bailouts. All the crony capitalism and insider deals. All the trillions in debt. 
 
All made possible because of the unaccountable Federal Reserve. 
 
Will you add your name to the fight to Audit the Fed?https://randpaul.com/f/audit-the-fed?sr=819fb1a
 
Before the Senate left for August recess, I introduced Audit the Fed as an amendment to the Cyber-security Bill. 
 
And I will not rest until my colleagues are forced to stand in front of the American people and cast a vote on this vital legislation. 
 
I didn't run for the Senate to keep a seat warm. 
 
And I didn't enter this race just to be something. 
 
I'm running for President of the United States to defeat the Washington Machine and take our country back. 
 
And that means busting through the unholy alliance of the Big Government politicians in BOTH parties who sat on their hands because the Fed ""kept the good times rolling."" 
 
You and I saw the results of an unchecked central bank when the Fed-generated bubble exploded in 2008 and wrecked our economy. 
 
Ever since, our economy has been spinning its wheels as wages have stagnated and every day Americans feel the pinch as paychecks are stretched to the breaking point. 
 
But times were good for the well-connected as the Fed created money out of thin air to fund Big Government boondoggles like the bailouts and the failed Obama stimulus package. 
 
The status quo has failed too many Americans and I won't sit idly by. 
 
Changing Washington starts with forcing the Fed to open its books. 
 
It starts with slamming the breaks on the Fed's ability to increase the money supply and devalue the dollar while allowing Big Government to borrow trillions. 
 
And it starts with Congress passing Audit the Fed. 
 
I believe this is a fight you and I can win. 
 
I'm the only candidate to lead Hillary Clinton in five states won by Barack Obama because voters know I don't just brag about defeating the Washington Machine on the campaign trail, I have a proven record of fighting to upend the status quo. 
 
So I hope I can count on you to add your name to the fight by completing your ""Audit the Fed NOW"" petition:https://randpaul.com/f/audit-the-fed?sr=819fb1b
 
And after you fill out your petition, please chip in a contribution so I can continue to fight tooth-and-nail to break the Federal Reserve's print-borrow-and-spend cycle of economic disaster.",Strategic Message,Attack,Issue

The midnight August 31st end of month deadline is only hours away. 

The national media knows the Big Government establishment is floundering. 

They know it's only a matter of time until faux conservatives are exposed for what they are, bringing about another massive shake up in this race for the Republican nomination. 

And they want to know if I have the grassroots support it will take to WIN.

The truth is, September is when the rubber meets the road. 

It's when campaigns fight to turn their grassroots support into an on-the-ground organization capable of reaching every voter in the key early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. 

Thanks to your support, I'm not stopping there. 

In fact, just in the past two weeks, I've traveled to Alaska, Washington State, Wyoming, Idaho and elsewhere to mobilize supporters of liberty and limited government. 

Voters are thirsting for a candidate who is serious about reforming government -- not just blowing hot air. 

I ran for the Senate in 2010, standing proudly with the Tea Party because I worried our country was out of control. 

Once elected, my worst fears were proven right. 

Now, I'm running for President because I believe you and I can make a difference together. 

I believe we can protect the freedoms that have made America the greatest nation in human history with my concrete plans to: 

>>> Cut government spending and tackle our $18.3 TRILLION debt; 

>>> Repeal 100% of Obamacare; 

>>> Secure our borders NOW! 

>>> Pass my 14.5% Fair and Flat Tax to unleash economic growth; 

>>> Audit the Federal Reserve and expose their corruption and cronyism; 

>>> Stop government spying on innocent American citizens; 

>>> Stand up for the right to life and DEFUND Planned Parenthood! 

As a U.S. Senator, I've charted a far different course than most politicians . . . 

I've kept my promises. 

I've delivered. 

If elected President, I will deliver again. 

And with your help, I believe we can restore the freedom and prosperity that should be every American's birthright.

While I am in this race to tear down the big government status quo by blowing up our tax code, the Republican establishment's hand-picked candidate believes in tip-toeing around the mess Barack Obama created. 

You can't defeat the Washington Machine by tearing out a couple of pages of our over 70,000 page tax code. 

You need to drive a stake through the heart of the IRS. 

Will you stand with me in the fight to kick the IRS out of your life for good by adding your name to the ""Fair and Flat Tax Now!"" petition: https://randpaul.com/f/tax-plan-video?sr=909fb1a 

I've proposed the biggest and boldest tax cut in American history. 

My 14.5% Fair and Flat Tax puts Washington on a diet and puts over $2 trillion back in Americans' pockets. 

The establishment candidate's proposed plan contains a top rate of 28% and cements multiple tax brackets where my plan has only one low rate of 14.5%. 

My plan ends corporate welfare by eliminating the giveaways in the tax code the well-connected use to game the system. 

His plan allows the Washington Machine's pals to nest their corporate welfare in our tax code. 

The Fair and Flat Tax I've proposed eliminates the workers' tax. 

It goes to ZERO. 

My establishment opponent's plan keeps FICA -- the largest tax many Americans pay -- in place. 

Our party can't skirt around the edges of the status quo. 

This is our best chance in a generation to deliver true conservative change to America. 

The American people are searching for a candidate with bold proposals to take our country back. 

Kicking the IRS out of the lives of everyday Americans is step one in defeating the Washington Machine. 

My campaign has prepared a special video explaining how my Fair and Flat Tax plan will restore the American dream. 

I hope you'll take a few moments to watch it and complete your ""Fair and Flat Tax Now!"" petition: https://randpaul.com/f/tax-plan-video?sr=909fb1b

The bailouts, the failed stimulus package and ObamaCare were all payoffs to the Washington Machine cronies that plunged our nation deeper into debt and eroded our freedoms. 

And the politicians in both parties would pay lip service to the Constitution, while scheming behind closed doors to undermine our values. 

So I ran for office even when the big shots in my own party lined up behind their handpicked candidate. 

I defeated the establishment because I had the support of patriots like you. 

And since day one in office I have fought to defend the Bill of Rights. 

You see, America is exceptional because 228 years ago today our founders delivered a revolutionary document that restrained government. 

The framers meant every word that prioritized the liberty of Americans above the power of government. 

And while there has been a constant struggle between those who would expand the powers of the federal government and those who defend liberty, I have been proud to always stand for the Bill of Rights. 

Not when it was convenient. 

Not some of the time. 

Or even most of the time. 

But all of the time. 

And that is the choice our party faces in t",Call to Action,,

228 years ago our Founders gathered in Philadelphia and created a document unlike any other. 

Our Constitution outlined checks and balances and separation of powers which restrained the power of the federal government.

But politicians in Washington these days treat our U.S. Constitution like a doormat -- treading and trampling on it at every opportunity. 

As a result, our freedom and liberty have never been under greater assault. 

I'm running for President to restore the Constitutional principles that made America the most free and prosperous nation on Earth. 

Will you please stand with me by making your most generous contribution of $20.16 or more IMMEDIATELY? https://secure.randpaul.com/?constitution-day&sr=918fb1a 

The powerful special interest lobby that controls the Washington Machine is desperate to crush anyone who truly believes in individual liberty and Constitutional government. 

And they're going all-out to silence my campaign and stamp out my message of liberty. 

But no matter how heated it gets, no matter how vicious the attacks, I will NOT back down -- not now or ever!

After our strong debate performance Wednesday night I headed to Nevada (Thursday) and South Carolina (Friday) before finally trekking to Michigan.

I wasnÂt the only one making the trip. I was joined by Carly Fiorina, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, John Kasich, and others from around the country.

What was so important to take us all to the Mackinac Island Republican Leadership Conference this weekend? The most important straw poll of the year.

And we won! Will you help us continue the momentum by chipping in a contribution right away.
https://secure.randpaul.com/?constitution-day&sr=rhf092015fb1

This Straw Poll has long been one of the best predictors of who the nominee is.

It was started way back in 1953. And most recently in 2011, Mitt Romney won it before he won the nomination.

In 2007, Romney won it and McCain took 2nd place Â then Romney won Michigan and McCain the nomination.

This year is even more important because the Iowa Straw Poll was cancelled, leaving Mackinac as the oldest most respected remaining straw poll.

We are approaching the September 30 FEC quarterly deadline where we will be required to report out our fundraising figures.

That quarterly report will be reviewed by our opponents, reporters, and pundits and used to judge the strength of this campaign.

A strong quarter combined with this impressive Straw Poll win creates another boost for us.

I felt good coming into the Straw Poll because we had a great debate performance. In the days since weÂve been getting our biggest crowds of the campaign. People want a bold, transformational candidate. 
 
My flat tax would gut the IRS and eliminate the 70,000 page tax code. ItÂd lower taxes on every American and eliminate special deals for Wall Street.

My plan balances the budget in five years and eliminates $500 billion in spending IN ONE YEAR and abolishes four cabinet departments.

And my plan to pass term limits will get rid of the career politicians in both parties. And IÂd require Congress to read the bills before voting on them.

And clearly at this major grassroots gathering these issues resonated.

So please help us continue the momentum right now by chipping in a contribution of $20.16.

With the September 30th FEC reporting deadline just ten days away, building momentum is crucial. 
 
And after a strong debate performance and a win at the Mackinac Island straw poll, I need your help to ensure my message breaks through all the noise in this primary. 
 
You see, the establishment and their pals in the liberal press are trying to diminish my bold agenda. 
 
The media gatekeepers want to direct everyone's attention toward celebrity and bickering between candidates. 
 
My focus has always been on my transformational agenda. 
 
I want to abolish the IRS and slash taxes for all Americans with my 14.5% Fair and Flat Tax Plan. 
 
We need term limits to end the reign of career politicians. 
 
All of ObamaCare MUST be repealed. 
 
And Planned Parenthood MUST be defunded of every dime of taxpayer money. 
 
This doesn't always make me the most popular guy in Washington. 
 
Even members of my own party have opposed my stands to end illegal NSA spying and cut off the flow of your money to Planned Parenthood. 
 
I'm in this race to break the Washington Machine's grip on power. 
 
For too long, no matter who wins elections -- nothing seems to change. 
 
Republicans take power and the debt balloons and government grows. 
 
But this election gives constitutional conservatives a chance to stop Big Government in its tracks. 
 
And I'm the only candidate with a plan to take our country back. 
 
This race is wide open, and with Hillary Clinton's campaign sagging under the weight of scandal, constitutional conservatives have the best chance in a generation to nominate a candidate who champions of our values.

FOR ANALYSIS, REPULL THE MESSAGE~~!~~ The Big Government political establishment was supposed to have this all sewn up by now. 

But polls show the race for the Republican nomination for President of the United States is wide open. 

And with the September 30th End of Quarter Fundraising Deadline rapidly approaching, I'm not going to mince words. 

This is by far THE most critical fundraising deadline I've ever faced. PERIOD. 

So I'm counting on your IMMEDIATE action. 

The press and the Big Government establishment of BOTH parties are already sniffing around to see if my campaign has the grassroots support and resources it will take to surge to the top of the Republican Primary polls. 

They know Americans have begun to zero in on the race for the White House with the launch of the Republican debates -- and are just now digging into candidates' records and plans. 

And they know this is the last FEC reporting deadline before all candidates begin their massive end of year push to 2016. 

As more punches are thrown, polls will change. This massive field of 15 Republican candidates is going to quickly start whittling down to just a handful. 

My campaign is laying the groundwork to surge to the top. 

But it's so critical I have a strong quarter. So I'm counting on your support: https://secure.randpaul.com/?q3&sr=923fb1a 

From the very moment I launched my candidacy for the presidency of the United States, Democrats and their pals in the press have gone all-out to SMEAR me. 

It hasn't worked. 

Many polls show I'm the ONLY Republican candidate to beat leading Democrat Hillary Clinton in five key swing states President Obama won in both 2008 and 2012. 

We have an unmatched and growing on-the-ground presence in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. 

Energy is sky-high as GOP loyalists and political newcomers step forward to ""Stand With Rand"" and fuel an exploding volunteer base.

Already, this past week my campaign has received a boost of momentum. 

I've passed one test of organizational strength and grassroots support by winning the Mackinac Island straw poll in Michigan. 

And in the last debate I turned in a strong performance by outlining my plan to take our country back by: 

>>> Ending the IRS with my 14.5% Fair and Flat Tax that will slash taxes for all Americans as everyone pays one low rate. 

>>> Repealing ALL of ObamaCare. 

>>> Kicking career politicians out of office with term limits. 

>>> Stopping illegal NSA spying once-and-for-all. 

I made it clear, if you like Big Government there will always be a Bush or a Clinton for you to pick from. 

But I stood along on stage as the only candidate to defend ALL of the Bill of Rights. 

So my campaign has prepared a new TV ad detailing my plan to defeat the Washington Machine. 

By picking a candidate propped up by the same party establishment that failed to fight Barack Obama and the Democrats, our party is throwing our best chance in a generation to elect a President who will boldly champion our values. 

With the September 30th deadline just one week away my campaign needs the resources to bust my message through the noise the media is generating.

But the liberal media is desperate to crush and destroy me and my campaign. 

That's why, with the September 30th End of Quarter Fundraising Deadline rapidly approaching, I really need you in my corner. 

Take a moment to read Doug's memo, and then please agree to chip in a generous contribution of $20.16 right away: https://secure.randpaul.com/?q3&sr=923fb3

Thank you in advance for your support.

### MEMORANDUM ###

TO: Rand Paul 
CC: Rand Paul for President Team 
FROM: Doug Stafford, Chief Strategist 
RE: End of Quarter Campaign Update 
DATE: September 23, 2015 

--- Summary --- 

The Washington spin machine is desperate to tear down and destroy this campaign. 

But experience shows that presidential campaigns that are built on a strong foundation and practice strong fundamentals are the ones around when the snow begins to fly. 

--- Consider --- 

In 2012, according to a University of Iowa poll, Herman Cain was at 37% on October 19th. On caucus day in January, Herman Cain got 0% of the vote. In fact, many of the early frontrunners like Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich fizzled on caucus day in Iowa. 

But the final contenders were the ones who put grunt work in early in the campaign and saw that work pay off in the end. 

That's why, from day one, we built a campaign designed to withstand the day-to-day ups and downs and build the grassroots force needed to win the Republican nomination. 

And it's beginning to pay off. 

As Breitbart recently noted, ""Rand Paul has built one of the most",Call to Action,,

FOR ANALYSIS, REPULL THE MESSAGE~~!~~ You and I are supposed to be punching bags for the national media and pro-abortion members of BOTH parties.

We're supposed to play nice and smile for the cameras while abortion apologists demean us with every ugly smear in the books. And you and I are never, ever supposed to go on the offense! 

Those are the unwritten rules in Washington, D.C. when it comes to the abortion debate. The rules -- with the help of good folks like you -- I'm breaking each and every day.

But for daring to lead the fight to defund Planned Parenthood and turn the tables on pro-abortion Democrats, I'm being attacked like never before.

So with the FEC's September 30th End of Quarter fundraising deadline rapidly approaching, will you please agree to your most generous contribution of $20.16 or more today: https://secure.randpaul.com/?q3&sr=924fb1a

Just a few days ago, someone showed me an email sent out by national Democrats attacking me for leading the fight to defund Planned Parenthood.

Reports show I've been attacked by Democrats more than any other candidate.

They know I don't play by their rules. 

And they know a President who will boldly stand up and expose their pro-abortion radicalism are the abortion lobby's worst nightmare.

That's exactly what I will do if elected President. That's exactly what I've done throughout my entire life. 

In fact, my campaign has put together a special ""Sanctity of Life"" video, which you can see here.

My first public speech as a teenager was made urging members of my church to take a stand on the issue of life.

As a medical student, I refused to have anything to do with abortion.

As a physician, I treated premature babies virtually every week -- and I saw firsthand just how precious these little lives were. The same lives the pro-abortion left tells us are worthless.

As a U.S. Senator, I've earned a 100% pro-life rating from National Right to Life. 

I introduced the National Life at Conception Act to end abortion nationwide.

I learned very quickly that I'd have few allies in my fight against reckless spending and big government. 

While lots of folks use the word Republican, there are few true conservatives. I can say with confidence that my friend and ally, Rand Paul, is a real conservative who hasn't been afraid to take on the Washington establishment -- however unpopular that may be. 

Will you agree to Stand with Rand by chipping in a contribution of $20.16 before the September 30th deadline: https://secure.randpaul.com/?q3&sr=925fb1a 

Rand is a doctor, not a career politician. 

I think one of the largest problems in Washington is that we have too many career politicians. 

Rand and I have fought for term limits in hopes that we can get real people, who have real world experience, to come to Washington and shake things up. 

Rand has led the fight to defund Planned Parenthood, his tax plan would abolish the IRS and destroy the 70,000 page tax code, and he's working to return our country to the principles of liberty and limited government. 

I'm proud to Stand with Rand, and I hope you can join me by chipping in a contribution of $20.16 before the September 30th deadline: https://secure.randpaul.com/?q3&sr=925fb1b

My jaw dropped when I heard the news earlier this morning. 

I know Washington insiders must be beside themselves with the unexpected news.

Will you please contribute as generously as you can to my campaign's End of Quarter Fundraising Blitz right away: https://secure.randpaul.com/?q3&sr=925fb2a

If you want the next Speaker of the House -- and the next President -- to be a true limited government champion, please act right away. 

I'm running for President to deliver on my detailed plan to defeat the Washington Machine and take our country back by: 

>>> Ending the IRS with my 14.5% Fair and Flat Tax that will slash taxes for all Americans as everyone pays one low rate; 

>>> Repealing ALL of ObamaCare; 

>>> Kicking career politicians out of office with term limits; 

>>> Stopping illegal NSA spying once-and-for-all.

Capitol Hill is RED HOT right now! 

From ObamaCare, to illegal executive amnesty, to funding Planned Parenthood, surrender was always the first option for many of my Republican colleagues. 

As a result, our party's nominating contest is wide open as voters are rejecting the establishment candidates the media thought would cakewalk to victory.

But the American people are angry. 

In fact, last month polls showed the American people's trust in government is at an all-time low. Half of Americans see government as a threat to their liberty. 75% see government as corrupt to the core! 

While the Big Government establishment has nothing to offer but the status quo, I'm offering real change -- and a real return to constitutional principles.

The truth is, this FEC End of Quarter Fundraising Period is by far the most important of my campaign. Reporters and members of BOTH parties are already sniffing around to see what kind of grassroots strength I'm building. 

A big fundraising quarter for me will help show the Big Government establishment their days are numbered! 

So won't you please give as generously as you can to help send this message? 

The truth is, the race the establishment was supposed to have all wrapped up by now is anyone's race. 

With the recent announcement of House Speaker John Boehner's resignation, the D.C. insiders are up in arms wondering which direction our Republican Party should go. 

Should we opt for more of the same? 

Should we put our trust in charlatans who will tickle our ears only to give us nothing but the status quo? 

Or should we boldly and unabashedly stand for our principles, take the fight to President Obama and stand for what we believe in? 

Fakes, phonies and faux conservatives won't dig our country out of $18.3 TRILLION in debt. 

They won't restore our Bill of Rights.

In just a moment I'm going to ask you to chip in a contribution of $20.16 to my End of Quarter Fundraising Push. 
 
I'm being direct with you because the truth is, money really is that important. It's a big deal. 
 
Lack of funding is the primary reason two Republican candidates have dropped out of the race in the past few weeks. 
 
Of course, my campaign is built for the long haul. My recent victory in the Mackinac Island Republican Leadership Conference straw poll proves that our organization and grassroots force is unmatched. 
 
But even grassroots-driven campaigns require money. There are offices, staff, phone banks, yard signs, materials, campaign travel, and many of the other expenses necessary for a campaign to function. 
 
And since the Washington Machine's gatekeeper's in the press are attempting to silence my campaign and stamp out my liberty message, I need even more resources to bust through their wall and take my message directly to the voters. 
 
TV, Internet, and radio ads. Email and direct mail to targeted voters across the country. It all adds up. 
 
That's why I told you I was going to ask you to chip in a contribution of $20.16. Those primary operations are essential to my campaign.

So today can I count on you to please chip in a contribution of $20.16 to my End of the Quarter fundraising push? 
https://secure.randpaul.com/?q3&sr=927fb1
 
The upcoming September 30th FEC End of Quarter Fundraising Period is by far the most important of my campaign.

But if $20.16 is just too much at this time, I hope you'll consider contributing $15, $10 -- even $5.

And if they succeed, they'll go on to even more spending, spying, welfare and warfare in Washington, D.C. 

I was able to weather the media's viciousness because I had patriots like you at my side. 

Because good folks like you stood with me, the Washington Machine failed. And our Liberty Movement continues to grow. 

But unlike other candidates, Rand isn't depending on Wall Street fat-cats and banksters who want more special treatment, bailouts and stimulus packages to bankroll his candidacy. 

Rand is depending on patriots like you who are willing to fight to take our country back. 

This is by far the most important fundraising deadline of Rand's entire campaign. 

And every dollar is critical. 

So please agree to make your most generous contribution of $20.16 to help Rand fight back against the Washington Machine's smears.

FOR ANALYSIS, REPULL THE MESSAGE~~!~~ ### Are they a bunch of cowards? ###

Enough is enough. 

President Obama thinks he can bully everyone around him and force his will on the rest of the country on ObamaCare, Planned Parenthood and more out-of-control spending. 

Far too many of my colleagues would rather shrug and surrender to Obama's demands before the fight even begins -- instead of standing up and fighting back against his Big Government policies that are ripping this country apart. 

We're told the worst thing that could happen is a government shutdown. 

But I'm voting against the short-term spending bill designed to keep government open past the Wednesday deadline because I think the worst thing that could happen is if the Big Government gravy train keeps chugging along. 

With the FEC's End of Quarter deadline rapidly approaching in just over 48 hours, can I count on you to stand with me during this critical time: https://secure.randpaul.com/?q3&sr=928fb1a

The American people aren't going to take it anymore. 

I'm sure you've heard every excuse imaginable that some of my colleagues use to justify waving the white flag and avoiding a confrontation with Obama. 

""We'll defund Obama's Big Government policies once Republicans have the White House."" 

""Obama will blame us if the government shuts down."" 

""We just don't have the votes to override Obama's veto."" 

The American people didn't vote for a Republican party who will surrender at every turn in 2014. And they won't vote for one if our party continues along this path in 2016, either. 

I'm not falling for their excuses. I won't run and hide. 

I'm confident if I stand and fight, the American people will stand with me. 

That's why, with the End of Quarter reporting deadline just over 48 hours away, I'm counting on you to make your most generous contribution to help me show the liberal press and Big Government apologists that the American people desperately want a President who will fight to slash Big Government.

At the end of the week our campaign is required file a public financial report with the FEC.

The press and the Big Government establishment of BOTH parties are already sniffing around to see if my campaign has the grassroots support and resources it will take to surge to the top of the Republican Primary polls.

When the reports come out, they'll be hunting for anything they can use to help them tear down and destroy my campaign.

I've made a special video message about why every dollar you can afford to contribute at this time is crucial.

In just a moment I'm going to ask you to chip in a contribution of $20.16 to my End of Quarter Fundraising Push.

I'm being direct with you because the truth is, money really is that important. It's a big deal.

Lack of funding is the primary reason two Republican candidates have dropped out of the race in the past few weeks.

Of course, my campaign is built for the long haul. My recent victory in the Mackinac Island Republican Leadership Conference straw poll proves that our organization and grassroots force is unmatched.

But even grassroots-driven campaigns require money. There are offices, staff, phone banks, yard signs, materials, campaign travel, and many of the other expenses necessary for a campaign to function.

And since the Washington Machine's gatekeeper's in the press are attempting to silence my campaign and stamp out my liberty message, I need even more resources to bust through their wall and take my message directly to the voters.

TV, Internet, and radio ads. Email and direct mail to targeted voters across the country. It all adds up.

That's why I told you I was going to ask you to chip in a contribution of $20.16. Those primary operations are essential to my campaign.

So today can I count on you to please chip in a contribution of $20.16 to my End of the Quarter fundraising push? https://secure.randpaul.com/?q3&sr=929fb1b

The upcoming September 30th FEC End of Quarter Fundraising Period is by far the most important of my campaign.

If you're with me in this fight for the long haul to defeat the Washington Machine and take our country back, I need you to chip in a contribution of $20.16.

But if $20.16 is just too much at this time, I hope you'll consider contributing $15, $10 -- even $5: https://secure.randpaul.com/?q3&sr=929fb1b

FOR ANALYSIS, REPULL THE MESSAGE~~!~~ You and I have been asked to give everything we have to try and save this country -- to get Big Government off our backs -- and nothing ever changes. 

The Washington Machine keeps humming along -- as politicians in BOTH parties don't dare do anything but whittle around the edges of Big Government. 

But today is your chance to help me send a loud and clear message that the days of broken promises are OVER! 

A brand new Reuters poll released this morning shows my campaign is surging in the polls and I've now leaped into 5th place over the past five days. 

But the FEC's September 30th midnight deadline is just hours away. And my campaign has a goal of raising $450,000 before midnight tonight. It's critical we reach our goal. 

Will you please agree to your most generous contribution at once to help make sure I hit my goal and continue my surge in the polls? https://secure.randpaul.com/?q3&sr=930fb1a

Unlike so many of my opponents in this race, I'm not interested in just whittling down the Washington Machine. I'm interested in DESTROYING it once and for all. 

Instead of false bravado masquerading as principle, my campaign is offering real plans to gut Big Government and restore liberty to the American people by: 

*** Cutting taxes for every American. My 14.5% flat tax would return $2 TRILLION to the American people over 10 years, create 1.4 million new jobs and grow our GDP by a whopping 10%. No other candidates' tax plan comes close to mine; 

*** Repealing ALL of ObamaCare. What's the purpose of the Republican Party if we can't repeal Democrat boondoggles? There's much that needs to be ended and repealed in Washington, and ObamaCare is a great place to start; 

*** Imposing term limits for Members of Congress. Career politicians are always the ones telling us what we ""can't"" get done, aren't they? If they ""can't"" do what we elect them to do, let's send them packing!

FOR ANALYSIS, REPULL THE MESSAGE~~!~~ Hillary Clinton is taking a page out of Obama's playbook of ""never letting a crisis go to waste."" 

After the recent tragic shooting in Oregon, I'm afraid Second Amendment supporters need to gear up for yet another massive push for gun control. 

Anti-gun members of the press are already demonizing Second Amendment supporters and shaming Congress for ""not taking action"" on what they call ""common sense"" gun control legislation. 

The stage is set for anything to happen -- including magazine bans, new regulations on gun shows and even expanded or universal ""background checks."" 

Can I count on you to take action by signing your ""STOP RADICAL GUN CONTROL"" petition right away? https://randpaul.com/f/stop-radical-gun-control?sr=1005fb1a  

I led the fight in 2013 that defeated ALL eight of Obama's anti-gun bills in the U.S. Senate -- and the field is ripe for yet another national showdown over your gun rights. 

As the most pro-gun candidate running for President, I won't hesitate to stand in the national spotlight and go toe-to-toe against Hillary Clinton and her anti-gun pals in the media. 

That's exactly what I did earlier this year when Obama's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) attempted to rush through a ban on common M855 ammo. 

Tens of thousands of grassroots supporters answered my call to action and stood shoulder-to-shoulder with me by flooding the BATFE with fax petitions. Just a few days later, the BATFE reversed course and shelved their anti-gun scheme, and Obama's backdoor ammo ban was defeated. 

But I'm worried about what could happen if Second Amendment supporters let down our guard. 

After Hillary Clinton dangerously labeled Second Amendment supporters last year as a minority who ""terrorizes"" the majority of Americans, I truly believe the anti-gun crowd would happily shred our Second Amendment.

This is the biggest straw poll in the key early state of New Hampshire and a crucial test of who has the organization in place to turn out their supporters.

My victories in the straw polls at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Mackinac Island and last nightÂs Republican Liberty Caucus event prove one thing...
 
My grassroots-centered campaign can flex organizational muscle.
 
And this is especially important as two of the first four contests for President are caucuses -- which are won through disciplined grassroots organization. 
 
But you and I both know the liberal media trips over itself to try and dismiss my campaign. 
 
After all, I'm not their handpicked candidate.
 
My campaign isn't beholden to Wall Street or fat cat lobbyists. 
 
So I need your help to bust through the media blackout and take my message directly to the voters.
 
Your support will give my campaign the vital resources to continue the momentum and spread my message of liberty to Republican primary voters in key states like Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. 
 
But even grassroots-driven campaigns require money. 
 
There are offices, staff, phone banks, yard signs, materials, campaign travel, and many of the other expenses necessary for a campaign to function.
 
TV, Internet, and radio ads. Email and direct mail to targeted voters across the country.
 
It all adds up.
 
That's why I'm asking for your support to build on my important victory in last nightÂs Republican Liberty Caucus straw poll.

Despite the media covering this election as if it were a high school popularity contest, the upcoming debate gives my campaign a chance to break through. 

You and I both watched the Washington Machine and their allies in the media enact a media blackout to try and stop my father's presidential campaign... 

...And now they're doing the exact same thing to me. 

That's why, today, I'm announcing a TV and Radio Ad Blitz in Iowa to pepper the airwaves and reach as many voters as possible during and after the next Republican presidential debate. 

I'm ready to fight in the next debate. And my campaign staff has run the numbers and laid out a detailed plan to maximize this opportunity. We need to raise $200,000 before Tuesday, October 20th to make this work. 

And I'm counting on you to please stand with me during this most critical time by making your most generous contribution of $20.16 or more TODAY: https://secure.randpaul.com/?sr=1015fb1a 

America is on the brink of even more turmoil if patriots like you don't stand up and fight to save it. 

For the first time in decades, you and I have a true chance to nominate a Republican who will take a sledgehammer to the Washington Machine. 

I first ran for the U.S. Senate to take on this fight to restore our Constitution. 

I'm running for President to take our country back. 

My plan to institute a 14.5% flat tax, and return $2 TRILLION to the American people, isn't just designed to get our economy moving and create jobs. It's designed to blow up our current tax code and force government to live within its means. 

My plan to impose term limits in Washington, D.C. isn't just designed to change a few faces in Congress. It's designed to clean house of Big Government career politicians. 

My plan to force Congress to read the bills they pass isn't just designed to force members of Congress to stop passing thousand-page bills at the last minute, it's designed to END lobbyists' grip on Washington, D.C.

And just like the first two, I'm expecting the Washington Machine's gatekeepers in the press to once again double-down on their effort to stamp out my campaign and silence my message. 

But with your help, I plan to break through their wall of silence and get my message directly to voters. 

My campaign is preparing to launch a massive TV and Radio Ad Blitz to flood Iowa airwaves during and after the upcoming presidential debate. 

There's still air time available, but I must raise $200,000 by Tuesday, October 20th at midnight to make this work.

Unlike many of my opponents, my campaign isn't funded by a bunch of Wall Street fat-cats and special interests who are looking for special deals, breaks and bailouts. 

I'm not ""their guy"" and I never will be. I'm yours. 

For the first time in decades, you and I have a true chance to nominate a Republican who will take a sledgehammer to the Washington Machine. 

I'm running for President to deliver on my detailed plan to defeat the Washington Machine and take our country back by: 

>>> Ending the IRS with my 14.5% Fair and Flat Tax that will slash taxes for all Americans as everyone pays one low rate; 

>>> Repealing ALL of ObamaCare; 

>>> Kicking career politicians out of office with term limits; 

>>> Stopping illegal NSA spying once-and-for-all. 

But I must raise $200,000 by October 20th to bust through the media's wall and get my message out directly to voters. 

So please chip in a contribution of $20.16 right away: https://secure.randpaul.com/?oct20t&sr=1016fb1a

Our liberty message is resonating all across the country. 

I see it every day when I'm out meeting voters on the campaign trail. 

Everywhere I go, the crowds continue to grow. 

Hundreds of patriots attend each event -- and they enthusiastically respond to my plan to defeat the Washington Machine. 

And when it comes to on the ground organizational strength, no other campaign out there can compete with my campaign. 

In fact, I've competed against my opponents in three major presidential straw polls this year -- and I've WON all three! 

There's no doubt my campaign has the organizational strength and grassroots support necessary to make me the Republican nominee! 

But I must have the resources to break through the media's wall and get my message out to as many voters as possible. 

Will you please chip in $20.16 or more immediately to help make this a reality? 

Thank you in advance for your support.

Our momentum is growing. 

After winning the biggest straw poll in New Hampshire, a new poll shows my campaign in 3rd place with committed New Hampshire voters. 

Another poll today shows me surging to 4th place in Iowa -- less than a week after my Students for Rand college tour to rally 10,000 students to caucus for my campaign. 

Both of those polls are on top of a newly released CNN poll that shows me rising to 5th place nationally. 

Can I count on you to help me build on this momentum by chipping in a contribution of $20.16 or more TODAY? https://secure.randpaul.com/?sr=1022fb1a

I've won a three-for-three clean sweep in the biggest and most significant straw polls for the presidential race in 2015. 

But you won't hear about our success in the media because I'm not ""their guy."" 

And I never will be. 

But the media can no longer ignore or hide the strength of our movement and the grassroots infrastructure of my campaign. 

That's why my TV and Radio Ad Blitz in Iowa was so important. 

And thanks to the overwhelming support of thousands of patriots like you, my campaign is set to pepper the airwaves during and after the third presidential debate -- allowing me to break the media's stranglehold and directly reach the voters with my message of Liberty. 

But I'm not taking anything for granted. And I hope you won't either. 

I'm not selling my campaign to Wall Street lobbyists or fat-cat billionaires. My campaign is fueled and funded by grassroots supporters like you. 

So if you're with me in this fight for the long haul to defeat the Washington Machine and take our country back, I need you to chip in a contribution of $20.16: https://secure.randpaul.com/?sr=1022fb1b

This race could not be more wide open. So every dollar counts. 

Thank you for your continued support.

In Liberty,

It isn't working.

I'm writing to you in the car leaving my event tonight in Exeter, NH.   A standing room overflow crowd of over 300 people were shoulder to shoulder tonight to hear my message.

I told them about my plan to Audit the Fed and the upcoming vote next week.

I told them how I am the only fiscal conservative in this race with a plan to balance the budget and cut taxes.

I told them how I am the only candidate who is standing up for the entire bill of rights.

I told them about how we need a rational foreign policy that puts our security first and stays out of nation building and civil wars.

And I told it to packed rooms around the state of New Hampshire this week.

Don't be fooled by the media. Our message is out there.  It is resonating.  It is being heard.

And it is a message that can win.

I'm heading to Iowa for three days after this. I hope and expect I will see more of the same.

One  areas important to me is helping children understand what it means to be an American. My film, One Nation Under God, helps kids learn GodÂs role in our history, and you can get it for free while supplies last. Just visit freegoddvd.com/abetteramerica
 
But please donÂt wait. There are a limited number of FREE copies remaining.  My team at Learn Our History created this DVD because too many children don't know the story of God's role in American history. WeÂre giving it away for FREE because itÂs a story that every child has a right to know and itÂs just too important not to pass on. One Nation Under God teaches kids all about GodÂs role in the creation of our nation and how our rights and freedoms come directly from God, not the government. This is a subscription and if you choose to receive the film, you will just need to cover $1 s&h, and you will be set up to receive other great films from Learn Our History about important events in American history as they are released about once a month at an affordable, low price. Of course, since this is a free offer, thereÂs no obligation to continue. But youÂll love the positive, patriotic and faith based lessons that your children or grandchildren will learn. Learn Our History always guarantees that kids will learn and have fun, or your money back. So there's no risk.  Whether you choose to place an order or not, join me in committing to keep GodÂs role in American history as an important part of your child's education, and that all Americans remember God's love for America.",Informative,,

Teaching my kids and grandkids about Jesus has always been really important to me. ThatÂs why I love the video, ÂJesus Is The Good NewsÂ, from VeggieTales creator Phil Vischer.  And hereÂs some great newsÂyou can get it for FREE from my friends at Family Bible Films.  Just visit freejesusfilm.com/goodnews

But donÂt wait. Supplies are limited. Our entire family loves this DVD, and we know yours will, too!  ItÂs packed with a wonderful combination of puppetry, animation and live-action, telling the story of Jesus in a way that only Phil Vischer can! ItÂs part of his fascinating ""What's in the Bible?"" series that our family just adores. If you choose to receive the film, youÂll be asked to cover just $1 in s&h. And if you order now, youÂll be set up to receive future great films from Family Bible Films as they are released to you at Family Bible FilmsÂ regular low price. Of course, since this is a free offer, thereÂs no obligation or commitment. But we know your family will love these fun Bible lessons as much as we do. Family Bible Films always guarantees that kids will learn and have fun, or your money back. So there's no risk.

My new book "" God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy "" releases next week on Tuesday, January 20. ItÂs already generated a lot of attention because I make the case for why those who live with traditional moral values and respect for the Constitution arenÂt the outliers. The book was written with vivid illustrations of bigotry toward Christians and in plain language. I discuss the disconnect between those living in the Âcultural bubblesÂ of New York, Washington, and Hollywood vs. those who live in what I call the land of ÂGod, Guns, Grits, and Gravy,Â otherwise known as Âflyover country.

I truly believe your friends and family will find the themes of the book relevant and encouraging and will greatly appreciate any mention or recommendation you can make on your blog, social media like Facebook and Twitter, or in other communications to those in your address book, FB friends, or Twitter followers. I detail the attacks on our friends like the Duggars, the Benhams, and the Robertsons of Duck Dynasty and provide many examples of the intolerance of the secular left, all delivered or course, in the name of Âtolerance.Â
I realize itÂs a selfish requestÂI readily admit it! But I genuinely believe you and your friends will identify with the message.
IÂll be on a media and book bus tour starting Jan 17 and will conclude it with a nationally broadcast webcast for church and home viewing parts on Sunday night, February 8.

Join me on April 3, 2015 and Do Good on Good Friday in honor of Christ's ultimate act of service for us on the cross more than 2000 years ago. Doing 'good' simply means doing something for someone else as an act of faith. This act of kindness, can be random, it can be planned, it can be large, or it can be small.  All thatÂs important is that it comes from the heart.  Participation is free and easy.  

Our goal is to inspire and challenge Christians across our nation to powerfully join together for one day to demonstrate through acts of love, kindness and service the faith we hold dear. Good Friday represents the greatest act of kindness ever extended to mankind. Join millions of Christians on April 3, 2015 in service and prayer for our country and Do Good on Good Friday!

How about random acts of nondenominational terrorism?... In an interview with the leftwing website Vox.com, President Obama made several eyebrow-raising comments.  But heÂs getting the most blowback for his response to whether Americans are overreacting to terrorism.  Obama said itÂs entirely legitimate Âto be deeply concerned when you've got a bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris.Â  But it wasnÂt Ârandom.Â  It was a Jewish deli.  One of the radical Islamic ÂzealotsÂ even told French TV that they were singling out Jews. White House spokesman Josh Ernest defended ObamaÂs ÂrandomÂ description, noting that there were also non-Jewish people there.  So if the terrorists didnÂt check the religious affiliation of every customer in the Jewish deli before shooting, that makes it random? This Administration denies Middle East reality so much, next I expect them to deny that De Nile is a river in Egypt.",Strategic Message,Attack,Issue

The timetable for me has always been to decide sometime this Spring. Everywhere I go, people tell me they hope I run, but they miss the television show and would miss my being on radio if my candidacy caused it to cease as well.

ThatÂs why I have launched the Huckabee ExclusiveÂa members only service that gives you a seat at the table with unique commentary, daily podcasts, weekly videos, and a news summary of the big stories of the week with my thoughts on those stories. IÂll share more candidly than broadcast radio or TV allows, and there will be bonus features for the subscribers as well.

IÂd like to invite you to be a charter member of the Huckabee Exclusive. When you join, youÂll get members only access to the daily podcasts, videos, insightful articles on major stories of the week, and more. It is easy to log in from your smart phone or computer and download the material you want. Once you sign up, weÂll remind you when new material has posted so you wonÂt miss any of the sometimes in-depth, but always fresh views about the big stories and the meaning behind them.
This is an exciting new venture for me that I will be able to continue whether I run for office or not. The material on the Huckabee Exclusive wonÂt be available to just anyoneÂonly those who want a seat at the table.

If you have a smart phone, electronic tablet, or a computer, you can get my unique and fresh content delivered each day easily and quickly.

If only theyÂd spent more on advanced safety systems or better rail infrastructure, this wouldnÂt have happened! That attack overlooks two inconvenient facts. First, investigators now believe the most likely cause of the crash wasnÂt mechanical failure due to budget cuts, but that the engineer was heading into a curve at more than twice the speed limit. Second, Amtrak is already one of the biggest money pits in the budget.
Sean Davis of the government watchdog Media Trackers had a former classmate in that train crash, and was upset at the attempt to politicize it. So he looked up the numbers. You can find his article online at TheFederalist.com. He discovered that since Amtrak was created in 1971, itÂs run up over $31 billion in losses, all covered by the taxpayer. In 2013 alone, it lost $1.3 billion on our dime. Or rather, on 13 billion of our dimes. And what are we all paying for? Davis notes that itÂs mostly used in the Northeast, so the rest of the nation is subsidizing commuters who make more money on average than they do. And because itÂs run by the federal government, Amtrak is inefficiently managed and spends far more on salaries and pensions than on infrastructure. In 2013, Amtrak spent over $2 billion on salaries and recorded less than $690 million in infrastructure depreciation. Pension losses alone that year hit $425 million.
DavisÂ proposed solution is to just give Amtrak to some private rail company that can run it at a profit. You might think thatÂs too radical. But whatever the solution is to preventing derailments like this one, it doesnÂt lie in pouring even more tax money into a bottomless pit. Unless that money is used to buy more speed limit signs.",Informative,,

That means more than just picnics and sales and the start of summer.  ItÂs a time to offer tribute, prayers and thanks to the heroic men and women of AmericaÂs military who for over two centuries have laid down their lives to protect our freedoms.  

But we should also remember the many wounded warriors who survived the battles, but came home with deep and lasting scars.  They deserve the very best care we can give them.  Not only through the Veterans Administration, but through private aid groups, like K9s For Warriors.  ItÂs a non-profit group that provides service dogs to vets with PTSD, traumatic brain injuries and other disabilities, to help them return to civilian life with independence and dignity.  100 percent of individual donations go to the program.  And 95 percent of the service dogs they train are rescued from shelters.  So when you donate to them, you donÂt just help a veteran, you save a dog, too. Talk about doubling your money!

Five stones to take down the Philistine champion who towered over the Israelites.

Our campaign is David standing before Goliath. And our ideas and founding principles are our smooth stones.

We are challenging the Washington to Wall Street axis of power that has forsaken for too long the families and taxpayers of this country in favor of their own schemes to accumulate wealth and power. These same groups will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to fight back against our ideas, our principles and in some cases even our faith in God.

Regardless, I believe we can win the GOP presidential nomination and go on to defeat Hillary Clinton. To succeed though we need to fight back against the attacks that will surely come our way because we are threatening this axis of power.

That is why I hope you will make an immediate contribution of $50 or more today - https://MikeHuckabee.com/donate-online-today. Your response before midnight is critical.

This is the most important fundraising goal we have set yet, so reaching this goal is a top priority for our entire campaign.

I've worked on campaigns my whole life but nothing can prepare you for the challenge of managing a presidential campaign like being a wife and a mom. It makes you resilient in the face of tremendous adversity.

One way I've become more resilient is because of my husband Bryan. No, not because he's difficult to be married to, but because he has forced me to become a Kansas City Royals fan! 

Bryan has compared my dad's campaign to the Royals for the last several months.

Everyone in Kansas City loves the Royals, but few believed they can win. Until of course the Royals start to win and the stadium goes from empty to full and everyone is a ""true believer"" Royals fan again. Throughout the playoffs the Royals were declared dead, only to miraculously come from behind to win. The lesson is clear: never give up.

Being a Royals fan has reminded us time and time again to never give up . A much more dedicated fan wrote the post below and Bryan shared it with me. It's a great read this morning and a timely reminder to look for the moments of joy in the midst of adversity, persevere through it, and never give up:

In 1989, I watched Bo Jackson hit a homerun to lead off the all-star game on a small black and white TV in Tennessee while on family vacation. At the time, as an awestruck baseball loving 9 year old, I had no idea this would be my last great Royals memory for nearly 25 years.

In 1994, I watched as the Royals had an incredible 14 game winning streak.  Major League Baseball literally cancelled the season exactly one week later for the players to go on strike.

I thoroughly enjoy being able to connect with so many of you each night. Keep sending your questions to AskBen@BenCarson.com and I will keep our conversation going.

Question from Brent who wants to know what he can do to stop Planned Parenthood.  

I know millions of Americans are as angry as I am about what is going on at Planned Parenthood. First, tell all of your friends to call their Senators and Representatives. Leave voice messages, send emails, and write letters. Please, do everything you can. You can find your Representative and SenatorÂs contact info on my webpage www.BenCarson.com in the Action Center. We need to make a very loud noise to end this barbarism. The fight will take weeks, and all we need to do to make sure that nothing happens to Planned Parenthood is do nothing, and count on are so-called leaders to do the right thing. We must carry this fight to its rightful conclusion. Please stand with me. Go to my website and call your Senators and Representatives.

The next question is from Deb. She is concerned about Washington's inability to do something on immigration while more and more people walk across our border each day. 

Deb, maybe we should Deport Congress First. People risk their lives sneaking across the border because they know we don't enforce the law. Maybe we should start with deporting Congress.

Final question. I am hungry, so now is a great time to answer Ella's question. She is 8 and wants to know what my favorite food is. Ella, my favorite food is pizza, the more veggies the better. Now, I am really hungry.

Our children and grandchildren will be forced to burden our irresponsibility if we donÂt act quickly. Children born today already have a $60,000 share of our national debt. That is immoral.

FOR ANALYSIS, REPULL THE MESSAGE~~!~~ Each night I try and find some time to answer a few questions sent in by my Facebook friends.  You can send your questions by emailing them to me at askben@bencarson.com.

The first question tonight is from the OÂDonovanÂs.  They want to know about my thoughts concerning ObamaÂs deal with Iran.  Good question.  

The United States has frozen billions of dollars in Iranian assets and this deal sends all of that money to Iran.  They will undoubtedly further terrorism and buy arms that will kill thousands.  If that were not enough to be against the deal, the agreement also relies on Iran to police itself.  I think it is foolish to believe that this deal will in any way stop their desire for weapons of mass destruction.  Even if it did slow down their technology development, the desire will remain unabated.  I think it is a lousy deal.  I am 100% opposed.  The next President must not abide by it. 

The next question is from Tracey who is a small business owner.  Tracey wants to know what I plan to do about easing the burden on small business and help job growth.  

Tracey, we definitely think alike.  This administration has raised taxes, increased regulation, driven up energy costs, doubled our healthcare cost, and accumulated more debt than anyone in the history of our country.  Then, they wonder why the so-called ÂrecoveryÂ has been jobless.  Jobs are created by risk taking and innovation.  You have to create an environment where risk taking can flourish.  In order to unleash the might of our economy, we should become the most attractive place in the world to take risks, build factories and start a small business.  That means overhauling a tax scheme that has been gamed by the powerful, eliminating regulation that is strangling both small business and consumers, and actually cheerleading American business around the world.  We have all the energy and innovation anyone would need to dominate world markets.  We just donÂt have leaders with the vision to march this count",Strategic Message,Advocacy,Issue

She then did something unexpected and amazing, and donated $500 of her hard-earned money to my campaign.  Brandi, I am inspired and moved by your gesture and it is because of people like you that we will win this fight.

Back in June we held a ""Lunch with Ben"" sweepstakes where one supporter got the chance to join me for a private lunch on the campaign trail.

Our winner was Candace Salamone from Charlotte, North Carolina and she brought along her 12-year-old son. 

We had a great time, and I'm really glad we made the time to do it.

We've now decided to do it again and a new supporter, chosen at random, will have the chance to join me on the campaign trail for a private one-on-one lunch. Will it be you?

If you donate $5 or more right now, you'll be automatically entered for a chance to win.

If you're chosen as the winner, my campaign will handle all of the transportation and accommodations -- flights, hotel, everything.

It'll be a great opportunity to chat, to get to know one another, and talk about our desire to heal, inspire and revive our great nation.

Thank you for your ongoing support. I truly appreciate it.

Sincerely,
Ben

It seems that the new texting feature is becoming quite popular.  You can text me your questions by texting them to ASKBEN (275236).

The first question tonight is about whether or not I suspended my campaign.  Of course I did not.  It is yet another example of extremely poor journalism.  I know most of you already understand this, but you really canÂt believe everything you read.  If the left wing media can slant something to try and harm me they will do it Â even by taking every joke as a serious pronouncement when it benefits their cause. I am hard at work traveling the country Â from connecting with so many of you through personal interactions and even more on television Â and my focus will not change.

Lots of questions today about the new Quinnipiac poll in Iowa saying I am new leading Trump 28 to 20.  Those numbers were released this morning and the news went crazy.  Each day, more polls come out and we continue to grow.  As Barry and Ed sayÂCarson Fever is catching. I am gratified at our standing but please know I will work even harder to win more hearts and minds across this country.  Thank you Iowa, I will be in there tomorrow and all weekend.

Speaking of the weekend.  I will be on both Meet the Press and Fox News Sunday this weekend.  Chuck Todd is coming out to Iowa for Meet the Press and I will do a satellite feed to Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday, so set your DVR.

Finally tonight, I want to tell you that in the morning we will release our first big television ad.  The ad will begin airing in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada.  The ad was filmed at a rally we held in Iowa.  I think you will like it as much as I do.  You can view it in the morning on my website www.BenCarson.com.

Goodnight everyone and have a great Friday!

The next Republican debate is on Wednesday night at 8pm ET, and Ben has been getting ready.

As he prepares, I would love for him to hear from you. Let me tell you why.

Ben isn't running for President to build his resume. He doesn't want to be a politician. 

He's doing it for our children and grandchildren. Our Constitution was written for them -- to empower them and to ensure they'd have the opportunity to fulfill their God-given potential.

Before Wednesday night, I'd love to share some words of encouragement with him from his supporters around the country. Will you take a few minutes to leave him a note?

Just like the others before it, I know that in this debate Ben plans to be himself. He's not looking to attack his fellow candidates or score political points. He will want to share his story, his values, and his solutions for healing and reviving the nation that we both love.

I know how much he'll appreciate hearing from you, so I hope you'll leave him a note now.

Thank you so much for your prayers and your ongoing support. It means the world to us.

Sincerely,

Candy Carson

I have been to hundreds of towns and cities across this great country. But what about yours? Now is your chance to make that happen. Let me explain...

We are right on the verge of a huge milestone -- ONE MILLION individual grassroots donations. So today, we've launched a massive fundraising drive to help us get there.
If your donation happens to be our one millionth donation, I will put your town on my calendar and campaign there for a day.

You can donate any amount, and even encourage others in your town to do the same.

We're always trying to find new ways to show appreciation to our most dedicated supporters, and I think this could be pretty cool. So please go ahead and make your donation now.

At the very least, you'll be helping to take this campaign to a whole new level.

Thanks for all you do.

Matthew McClintock, who gave his life for his country earlier this week in Afghanistan. We must remember that freedom is not free and that the reason we are able to enjoy the liberties we cherish is because of people like Matthew. There are hundreds of stories that need to be told of the bravery and sacrifices of our troops and I will do my best to share them with you all. Like that of so many of America's service members, Matthew's service will not be forgotten.

""Staff Sgt. Matthew McClintock, of Des Moines, Wash., joined the Army in 2006 and served as a Special Forces engineer sergeant, the Washington National Guard said in a statement. McClintock deployed to Iraq in 2007 before being selected by the U.S. Army Special Forces School in May 2009, according to Army Times. He previously deployed to Afghanistan between August 2012 and May 2013 and left active duty for the guard in December 2014.
His most recent deployment to Afghanistan, which began in July, was with the Washington Army National GuardÂs Company A, 1/19th Special Forces Group and began in July, the Guard said. 

McClintock was killed by small-arms fire Tuesday during an hourslong battle in the Marjah district of Helmand province. Two other American troops and four Afghan soldiers were injured, military officials said. The coalition conducted 12 airstrikes in the area with a variety of aircraft, including F-16 fighter jets and an AC-130 gunship, said Col. Michael Lawhorn, spokesman for Resolute Support, the military coalitionÂs operation in Afghanistan.""

FOR ANALYSIS, REPULL THE MESSAGE~~!~~ Hello everyone, itÂs another night that we get to spend together during our nightly fireside chat. ItÂs been another great day in Iowa Â from getting to meet so many of you at Revive 714 and talking to Sean Hannity about how We the People will restore faith in our great nation to seeing so many of our team hitting the ground hard, the February 1st Iowa Caucus canÂt come soon enough! Remember, keep sending me your thoughts and comments by texting the number 275-236 (ASKBEN).

The first question tonight comes from Ryan who asks Âwhat are your thoughts concerning the Justice Department going after the people who exposed Planned ParenthoodÂs negligent practices?Â

Ryan, thank you for this important question. As I have said repeatedly Â the moment we start devaluing human life is the moment we lose our humanity. Without life, we have no hope for a future, tomorrow will never come Â we must not allow ourselves to become callous and indifferent to the slaughter of our most precious little ones. They are our hope. They are our future. No longer can we let these children's unrealized potential go unchecked into perpetuity. 

We have witnessed those who tried being a voice for the voiceless now being targeted by this administrationÂs Justice Department, an attempt to silence their plea for increased scrutiny regarding these heinous acts performed by Planned Parenthood Â I will not stand idly by and allow this to go unnoticed or brushed aside. I ask that you visit crsn.co/1KD9FBH and stand with me against these barbaric practices.

The next question comes from Ruth. She asks Âdo you feel the same way about the government and its overreach as I do?Â Ruth commented that she feels our government has become far too large and overreaching, especially for small businesses.

Yes, Ruth, I agree. The truth of the matter is government has come to resemble a ÂLeviathanÂ presence in America. It is lethargic and inefficient, reaching into our lives in ways our Founding Fathers never intend",Strategic Message,Advocacy,Image

He proved himself the best qualified candidate in the 2016 presidential race, addressing common sense solutions to the problems and concerns of the American People, demonstrating he is committed to keeping them safe and has the economic plans to make them prosper.
 
Dr. Carson proved he is a uniter, not a divider, setting aside pettiness of ""politics as usual"" and focusing on the solutions that will heal our nation.  He is the only candidate with the moral character and authority to lead America as Commander-in-Chief. Ignoring political correctness, tackling bullies like Putin, defeating ISIS and restoring our global leadership requires moral courage, not political expediency.
 
The debate stage is one of many avenues that Dr. Carson has used to share his vision to heal, inspire and revive America.  His website, www.BenCarson.com has more detailed policy positions than any other candidate, offering further proof that Dr. Carson is the most prepared to step into the Oval Office and lead from Day One.

Our first question tonight comes from Emily. Emily wants to know how I feel about the New Hampshire Primary tomorrow and what message I would have for voters in the state.

Great question, Emily! First and foremost, I am very much looking forward to the New Hampshire Primary tomorrow and I am confident that the people of the Granite State will cast their votes with conviction and careful consideration. As to what I would say to voters in the state; I would want to make sure that people know that as President, I will fiercely defend the Constitution of the United States, secure our borders and safeguard our nation from any threat. Most importantly, I will do what is in the best interest of We the People and not capitulate to special interests and the political elite. If the people of New Hampshire honor me with their votes, I promise to be a candidate of integrity who will follow through on the promises that I have made during this election process.

Our second question tonight comes from Lauren. Lauren wants to know what my thoughts were on this past weekendÂs debate and how I feel about the debate process in general.

Thank you so much for the question, Lauren. I believe that the debate process is an important part of the public being able to better get to know the candidates and for the candidates to be able to share their ideas with the American people as well as debate them in a public setting. Furthermore, we need to make sure that every candidate has an equal opportunity to present their ideas and need to get away from arbitrary debate requirements.

ItÂs been an amazing day on the campaign trail in South Carolina, and I just wanted to take a few minutes to answer a question that I received from a supporter today. As always, please continue to text your thoughts and questions to 275-236 (ASKBEN).

Ryan in South Carolina wants to know what steps I will take as President to reform our federal government and to tackle the corruption and bureaucracy in Washington D.C.

Thank you for the question. I have laid out on my website, bencarson.com, a detailed five step plan to reshape our federal government and to make it an entity that is first and foremost accountable to the American people. We must ensure that our leaders are held to high standards of performance and that that they meet the objectives that are crucial to the success of our nation. In order to accomplish this, we must first establish a criteria for analyzing the resources that are needed for our government to accomplish any given job and to then make sure that they receive what is needed to follow the job through to completion. 

However, revamping the current system will not be enough. We must experiment to seek out new forms of efficiency in our government and implement whatever successful course eliminates waste and unnecessary spending.  I want our government to be a body that is beholden to We the People, and so I propose that we create a system in which our government receives feedback from taxpaying, law-abiding citizens on how the government can better meet their needs. To further include our citizens in the happenings of their federal government, I propose that our government should be made to submit regular reports on the progress and cost-effectiveness of their decisions. I desire a streamlined communication process that is transparent and 100% accountable.

Thank you for the great question! I am looking forward to another great day tomorrow in South Carolina and I hope to see many of you at our upcoming events. - Ben",Strategic Message,Advocacy,Image

The weight and complexity of it are crushing everyday Americans, 59 percent of whom now have to hire a professional to help them with their taxes. It is also crushing the small and family-owned businesses that create 2/3 of our new jobs.
 
We need to radically simplify the tax code so that we can re-start the real engine of growth in our economy. That means our tax code needs to go from 73,000 pages down to about three pages.
 
We also need to move from revenue-neutral to revenue-reducing tax reform, because the federal government spends far too much money.
 
In order to do both of those things, we need to lower every rate and close every loophole. I will support a low, flat tax for businesses and individuals so that we fix the tax base and grow the economy. The Hoover Institution and Congressman Michael Burgess, M.D. both developed tax plans that do exactly this. Under their plans, both businesses and individuals can file their taxes on a simple form. They wonÂt need armies of accountants, lawyers, and lobbyists to figure out how to take advantage of loopholes and game the system because there will be no system to game.
 
Here is what the 3-page Hall-Rabushka tax code looks like.

In order to reduce our national debt, we need to grow the economy and cut spending. In 2014 alone, the government spent $3.5 trillionÂnearly $30,000 per household.
 
We have no idea how our money is being spent. In the last few weeks of every year, every agency spends every dollar because they donÂt want their budgets to be cut. They just want to talk about the rate of increase.
 
As President, I will move all agencies to zero-based budgeting so that every agency has to justify every dollar that they spend. The Zero Act does exactly this. It requires every agency to provide a description of their activities as well as a summary of the cost-effectiveness and efficiency to you, the taxpayer. As President, I will ensure we move to zero-based budgeting.

The morass of regulation is crushing the potential of this nation. Under the Obama Administration, federal agencies have imposed 14 new large-scale regulations that cost more than a billion dollars each. These regulations hurt the small and family-owned businesses that create 2/3 of the jobs in our nation.
 
In order to grow our economy, we must reduce the weight and complexity of the federal government.
 
As President, I will sign the REINS Act. The REINS Act is an important step toward holding the federal government accountable to taxpayers and their representatives, as it would require Congress to approve all regulations with an economic impact of over $100 million annually.
 
We must also require all federal agencies to regularly review the rules that they have on the booksÂand to repeal those that are no longer serving the best interests of the American people. Legislation like the Sunset Act would do this and, as President, I will push for its passage.

I will also ensure that the federal government moves to a meritocracy. In a seniority systemÂwhich is what we currently have in the governmentÂyou are paid for time in grade. You are not paid for performance. Over time, that means that people who are trying to do a good job get discouraged. We know from Inspector General reports that people who spend all day watching pornography receive the same pay, pension, and benefits as those trying to do a good job. As President, I will insist that all agencies eliminate the seniority system and move to a pay-for-performance model.

That is why the first thing I will do to ensure quality, affordable healthcare for every American is to repeal Obamacare.

Right now, weÂre on the ballot in every single state thatÂs had a deadline pass. And we continue to add more and more states every week: New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, and countless others.

But hereÂs the thing: this fight is far from over.

The political class is livid that weÂre doing as well as we are--and, in the weeks to come, theyÂll do everything they can to move the goalposts and cripple our efforts, before we have the resources to take them on in all 50 states.

IÂll be honest with you: a lot of hay has been made about where we are in the national polls. But at this stage of the game, polls arenÂt predictive of who the nominee is.
 
If December polls predicted presidents:
 
Newt Gingrich wouldÂve been President.
 
Howard Dean wouldÂve been President.
 
Rudy Giuliani wouldÂve been President.
 
And heaven forbid, Hillary Clinton wouldÂve been in her second term already.
 
Instead, nominees are the candidates who can mobilize support in early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. States where our campaign has already built--by far--the best and most effective ground game on the Republican side. States where our momentum and support continues to grow.
 
In coming weeks, national polls in this race will continue to fluctuate dramatically. Frontrunners will stumble. Dark horses will rise. We see that in every single election in the final weeks before the first primaries.
 
WeÂve laid exactly the foundation we need to win the nomination: weÂre booming in the early states, with sky-high favorability numbers. That means conservatives like our message and overwhelmingly trust me to lead this nationÂeven if I havenÂt yet earned their vote.
 
In the next six weeks, I will earn their vote. I will continue to work as hard as I can to make sure conservatives know our message, put their faith in me, and support this campaign all the way to the nomination.
 
But I canÂt do this alone. I canÂt win this fight without you.
 
With the FEC's quarterly fundraising deadline coming up fast on December 31, I need your help immediately to make the impact we need on this race: to win over the American people, and win this nomination.
 
Will you invest $3 in this campaign right now?

Right now, the momentum on the ground here is growing fast.

Iowa isnÂt like a lot of other states. Because weÂre the first state to caucus, what happens in Iowa affects the direction of the Republican primary race in all 50 states. We know itÂs a big responsibility.

Because of that, we donÂt listen to the mainstream media or national polls: we listen to the candidates (in person) and then vote for the one with the best message, and the best leadership abilities.

IÂve lived in Iowa a very long time. IÂve seen a lot of presidential campaigns come through hereÂand I can tell you that weÂve built the best ground game in Iowa this election cycle, hands down. Plus, we have Carly--who isnÂt afraid to dedicate as much time and energy as she possibly can to meeting Iowa voters and getting our message out.

ItÂs already beginning to pay off. Right now, all the talk on the ground in Iowa is about Carly FiorinaÂand our numbers are poised to continue to grow the closer we get to the caucus on February 1st.

But we canÂt continue to grow our momentum without your help.

During my visit to Nevada last week, I listened as voters described a battle that has played out in our country too many times. Parents and students are demanding more and better-quality education options because they know that the status quo is not working for them and their families--and lawmakers in Nevada have responded, working hard to implement innovative Education Savings Accounts that would allow parents and students to spend their education dollars as they see fit. Parents of all income levels and backgrounds are desperate for these choices, because they know that their kids deserve a chance.

And yet, as they have done too often, the Left has proven once again that they are willing to put kids back in failing schools in order to please a bloated, bureaucratic teachers union. We saw this in New York, where Mayor Bill de Blasio tried to limit school choice options--even as low-income and minority parents called for them. We saw it in Louisiana, where the Obama administration sued to shut down a program that allowed students to leave their failing public schools.

Hillary Clinton is committed to continuing this legacy. Is it any surprise that the two biggest teachers unions have already endorsed her? They're counting on her to maintain the status quo and protect their interests--even at the expense of our children's futures.

Liberals are on the wrong side of this issue. Their policies are trapping students and their families.

This week is School Choice Week--an opportunity for us to recognize the power of choice and accountability to help solve some of our nation's festering problems. We know that these programs work. In Boston, public charter middle schools cut the black-white achievement gap in math by as much as half in a single year when compared to traditional public schools.

I am a conservative because I know that no one of us is better than any other one of us. I know our policies work best to lift young men and women up, to arm them with the tools to realize their potential and use their God-given gifts. The two most important things in every childÂs education are a good teacher and an involved parent. You donÂt foster those with a bloated federal bureaucracy or national standards like Common Core Â you encourage them with choice and accountability.

We need to support the programs that work so that every parent has a choice and a chance to educate their children.

You can read more about my plans to put education decision-making back in the hands of parents and students here.

From the very beginning, the RNC and the mainstream media did all they could to keep us--and only us--off the debate stage in order to protect their failing establishment picks.

But the establishmentÂs despicable actions ramped up significantly more over the past few days: when they started intentionally doing everything they could to cripple this campaign.

Yesterday, one of the most powerful party bosses at the RNC came after me and this campaign with a below-the-belt hit on social media--simply because we dared to question the GOPÂs attempts to rig the game.

And on Friday, when my campaign tried to buy ad time during the debate, we were rejected. ABC so badly wanted to ban us from this debate altogether that they wouldnÂt even let this campaign pay for a TV commercial.

Luckily, the political class can only do so much. Voters like you still have the final say.

And believe me, voters are just as disgusted as we are: the harder the political class tried to shut us down over the last few days, the faster our momentum has grown. A new poll shows our support more than doubling in New Hampshire--now putting us within striking distance of frontrunners Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.

We can continue to grow our momentum and get our message out over the next few days--but getting our message out when weÂre the media and the GOPÂs Public Enemy #1 means weÂre in for our toughest fight yet. IÂm going to need your support now, more than ever before.

Can I count you in? Please pitch in $3 so this campaign can beat the political class at their own game--and make sure voters, not elites, get to pick our nominee this spring.

What started as an effort to dismantle IranÂs nuclear program has turned into a disastrous plan that will immediately enrich the Ayatollahs in Tehran, expand their ability to support violence and chaos throughout the region, and leave them as a nuclear threshold state.  Every new detail to leak out of the negotiating room makes the situation look more grim. President Obama should immediately suspend these talks. The United States should have a very clear message for Iran and the rest of the world: we will never lift sanctions or the arms embargo until Tehran abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions and support for terrorists.

I do know the man. 

I've traveled to the Middle East more than 35 times. 

I've spoken with global leaders about the catastrophic impact this deal will have on the world. 

Let me tell you: this deal grants Iran the framework to develop an industrial-sized nuclear program, enables them to build missiles to transport nuclear weapons, and funds them with more than $100 billion to implement their attacks.

The Iranian supreme leader will undoubtedly set his sights on destroying Israel and attacking America. And if Secretary Carter doesn't know that, this is not a good deal.

I will send American ground forces in larger numbers to Iraq. Aviation battalions. American helicopters flown by American pilots. Trainers at the battalion level so the Iraqi army could not cut and run. Forward air controllers so we can drop bombs on the right people. Special forces to kill ISIL leadership. 

And Syria: I donÂt see a ground force inside of Syria capable of destroying ISIL and replacing Assad, because that window has closed. ThereÂs nobody left in Syria to train, so you have to get a regional army of Arabs and Turks, and weÂll be a part of it.

I have not heard a plan from any other candidate in this race that sounds any different than President Obama's. And we all see how well that's working.

John Brabender, our Senior Campaign Advisor, said: ""When Hillary announced she was running for president, it was no surprise that she quickly disappeared into the Clinton bunker.  We thought it would be fun to take a look inside the Clinton campaign since very few will ever get a chance to see what really goes on in Hillary World.""
 
The Clintons have been one of the most secretive, least transparent political operations in American history.  From trying to sell access to the Lincoln Bedroom to covering up details in the terror attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens, the Clintons have time and time again used their power and influence to hide from the American public.  RealWorldHillary.com paints the picture of what the Clinton political operation looks like from an outsider's perspective.
 
RealWorldHillary.com highlights the Clintons' tradition of secrecy with a unique look inside the Clinton Campaign - from auctioning off access to donors to shredding incriminating documents.  In the coming weeks, the Santorum Campaign will launch an online contest for real Americans to submit their own videos of how they believe the Clinton Campaign operation works.  Selected submissions will be added to the website.
 
The launch of RealWorldHillary.com is a continuation of Senator Santorum's commitment to focusing his efforts on contrasting his conservative vision with the liberal vision of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.  Senator Santorum is committed to not delving into the interparty fights that have erupted in recent weeks, and instead focus his attention where it belongs - defeating Hillary Clinton.",Strategic Message,Attack,Image

It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent. The American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges. All judges should be held to that standard. I do not feel that oneÂs heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial.

Over the past few weeks, I have watched as the media has reported one inaccuracy after another concerning the ongoing litigation involving Trump University. There are several important facts the public should know and that the media has failed to report.

Throughout the litigation my attorneys have continually demonstrated that students who participated in Trump University were provided a substantive, valuable education based upon a curriculum developed by professors from Northwestern University, Columbia Business School, Stanford University and other respected institutions. And, the response from students was overwhelming. Over a five year period, more than 10,000 paying students filled out surveys giving the courses high marks and expressing their overwhelming satisfaction with Trump UniversityÂs programs. For example:

Former student Tarla Makaeff, the original plaintiff in the litigation, not only completed multiple surveys rating Trump UniversityÂs three-day seminar ÂexcellentÂ in every category, but also praised Trump UniversityÂs mentorship program in a glowing 5 plus minute video testimonial. When asked Âhow could Trump University help to meet [her] goalsÂ, she simply stated Â[c]ontinue to offer great classes.Â Once the plaintiffsÂ lawyers realized how disastrous a witness she was, they asked to have her removed from the case. Over my lawyersÂ objections, the judge granted the plaintiffsÂ motio",Strategic Message,Attack,Issue

A year ago, today, many of you joined me at Trump Tower in calling for real change in Washington, D.C. I am proud to say that with your support we are well on our way to Making America Great Again!  Since the moment I rode down the escalator on June 16th, 2015, and decided to run for President, my campaign has been filled with nothing but excitement, dedication, and passion to change our country for the better Â this is only the beginning of our movement.

I am honored and proud to lead our fight to put America first. This past year, I have travelled this great country and met many incredible Americans at our rallies. Yesterday in Atlanta, Georgia- we had a packed house of loving supporters. Even early on in our campaign, we had a record-setting rally in Mobile, Alabama, with over 30,000 attendees that joined our movement to Make America Great Again.

The Republican primary began with 17 experienced and talented candidates for President. At the Ronald Reagan Library on September 16th, your overwhelming support showed that our campaign had the message that resonated with hard- working Americans, and that DC-centric way of thinking is no longer capable of leading our country.

My campaign has been one of honesty and substance. We have created much-needed dialogue around the important issues facing our country. YouÂve seen my leadership in setting the agenda this whole political season, on both sides of the aisle. We wouldnÂt be talking about illegal immigration. We wouldnÂt be talking about the drugs pouring in and the bad trade deals costing American jobs. We wouldnÂt have called the terrorist attack in Orlando for what it is: radical Islamic terrorism. Politicians are all talk and no action. 

The support of many wonderful Americans, led to resounding victories in the Republican Primary race, in which we beat the rigged political system and biased media with landslide victories. Our success began on February 9th, with an emphatic win in N",Strategic Message,Advocacy,Image

WRONG: https://www.lyingcrookedhillary.com/lie/secret-server-hillary-broke-the-rules-lied-about-it

A report by the State DepartmentÂs own watchdog destroys ClintonÂs lie that she followed the rules. She did not get permission from anyone to exclusively use private email for all of her government work; she failed the requirement to use an authorized and secure system for her email communications; she broke federal records laws by shielding her official records from congressional and public scrutiny; and, she ignored warning after warning that her setup posed a significant cybersecurity risk.

My Child Care Reforms That Will Make America Great Again!

Thank you. I want to applaud my daughter, Ivanka, for her work and leadership on the issues facing working moms in our country. She has been deeply invested in this since long before the campaign began, and I am so grateful for her work and efforts on this proposal which I will be outlining today.

I want to also take a moment to recognize Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a mother of three small children, who has been such a leader on these issues. We are also joined tonight by some amazing members of Congress in our audience: Congresswoman Blackburn, Lummis, Black, and Ellmers.

Our campaign is about ideas. WeÂre about solutions. IÂve travelled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and your family.

IÂve outlined detailed proposals for providing school choice, reforming our tax and regulatory code, lifting restrictions on American energy, rebuilding our military, changing our foreign policy, fixing our immigration policy, and keeping our country safe.

Right now, our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things. IÂm asking the nation to lift our sights, and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together, trust each other, and put the needs of our own citizens first.

We must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past and pursue a future where every American is honored and respected.

We have to reject the arrogance of Washington D.C. that looks down on everyday hardworking people. Too often those who have power have disdain for the views, beliefs and attitudes of those who donÂt have political power.

Those in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security, or the mom struggling to afford childcare.

That means we need working mothers to be fairly compensate",Strategic Message,Attack,Issue

Last night in Cleveland Jim Gilmore showed that he is ready to give the American people an honest plan to grow our economy with his five-point tax reform called ""The Growth Code"" to create jobs and increase the size of paychecks in middle-class America.

He was the only expert in foreign policy on the stage and offered a plan to create a new NATO in the Middle East.  No one else on the stage offered real world ideas to the challenges we face and planning the right solutions to protect American interests here and abroad.

Gilmore was the only candidate concerned about the defense budget sequester and how it impacts our image across the world when our allies and adversaries find out we are reducing our military sustainability.  

He is ready to lead right now and needs your support.  Please visit www.gilmoreforamerica.com and donate and sign up to volunteer.",Strategic Message,Advocacy,Issue

Statement by Jim Gilmore re: Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) August 7, 2015 Jobs Report

""The August 7 BLS jobs report says that almost 94 million Americans -- including over 56 million women -- aren't participating in the workforce. That means they want to work, they can work, but they've given up finding jobs because President Obama's policies are strangling our economy. 
 
""It's the lowest rate of workforce participation since about 1977. That means we're still in Obama's ""jobless recovery."" That's no recovery: it's a stalled economy. And if you're looking for a ""war on women"" here it is: an economic war being waged by Obama.
 
""Much of the middle class and blue collar America are being prevented from getting the jobs that provide a stable, family-sustaining income by the economic nightmare that President Obama has created.
 
""My Growth Code isn't a bunch of faculty lounge theories like the Obama-Clinton government has imposed.  This plan is a specific job-creating plan to raise us above the mess Obama has created by historically-proven policies that worked for Presidents Kennedy and Reagan. 
 
""If I am elected president, I will exercise my leadership skills to ensure congress turns the Growth Code into law quickly, and we will set about repairing the economic damage Obama has done.""

In ÂI Shall Be Free No. 10,Â Bob Dylan sings, ÂFee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay here I come.Â Jim Gilmore is going after Donald Trump, too.

The former Virginia governor and improbable presidential candidate has challenged Trump to a mano-a-mano debate. Trump has not responded to the invitation.

Self-preservation suggests Trump will reject the opportunity. Gilmore may not have made the cut for the main event in the Cleveland ÂdebateÂ among the GOPÂs presidential contenders, but he would knock Trump out the ring. Gilmore has said sensible things about outreach and national security. He promotes a pragmatic agenda. Trump lacks his command of the issues.

GilmoreÂs pursuit of the GOP presidential nomination defies explanation, but he certainly would expose Trump as an ignorant phony. And that explains why the bout will not come to pass.

Trump, like Obama, wants to nationalize healthcare and put the government in charge. His promises to get everyone better care and save money by having the government take over the healthcare system are exactly the same promises Obama made to get Obamacare passed.

Republican voters clearly understood the false promises of Obamacare, so Obama had to force his plan through Congress without the support of a single Republican. So here comes Donald Trump, seeking the Republican Presidential nomination, and instead of repealing and replacing Obamacare he'll just put his own brand of Obamacare in place.

For Immediate Release:
September 29, 2015
Presidential Candidate Jim Gilmore Will Pay $40,000 SC Filing Fee Today
   COLUMBIA, SC -- Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, a candidate for the Republican nomination for President, will be in Columbia today to pay the required $40,000 filing fee to be listed as a candidate on the South Carolina Republican Presidential Primary ballot.
    Gilmore will be at the headquarters of the South Carolina Republican Party headquarters located at 1912 Marion St. in Columbia at 11:30 a.m. this morning to file the paperwork for his candidacy and pay the fee to be on the ballot.  South Carolina's ""first-in-the-South"" GOP primary will be held on Feb. 20, 2016.
    Gilmore, a former U.S. Army intelligence agent, is a former crime busting prosecutor and a former Virginia Attorney General as well as a former Governor.  As Governor of Virginia, he cut taxes by more than $1.5 billion and created tens of thousands of jobs for working men and women.
    One of the most experienced candidates seeking the office of President, Gilmore is the former chairman of a national commission that warned about a domestic terrorist attack before 9/11 and is a recognized authority on homeland security and foreign policy. 
    To restore America's lagging economy and create jobs for working families, Gilmore has called for tax cuts for all Americans and a 15-percent reduction in the corporate tax rate for all business activity as well as the elimination of the death tax.

""Today Russia initiated air strikes in Syria, to support the Assad regime. Reports state that the attacks have been not against ISIS, but against U.S. allies seeking to overthrow the brutal, terrorist Assad regime.

This Russian action brings the world to a U.S.-Russian crisis, with a real danger of military conflict between our two countries.

The Obama administration has again been caught flat-footed, and Obama's response is making things worse.  Secretary Kerry says the Russian move requires the U.S. to ""deconflict militarily"".  Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter today said that Russia is ""making a mistake"", and that we have to engage in talks to ""bring them to the realization that their strategy is effectual."" What Kerry and Carter mean isn't clear to anyone except to the Russians. They perceive that we are in retreat. And we are.

The Russians know exactly what they are doing.  They are by action demonstrating that they will do anything, including going to war, to preserve the Assad regime.  There are no mistakes by the Russians, only intentional acts to push us as far as we can be pushed. Nothing Kerry, Carter or Obama has said indicates that we've stopped retreating.

All this is in the face of President Obama's clear statement at the U.N. on Sunday that Assad must go.  The coldly calculated Russian attack today makes President Obama look as weak and foolish as in reality he is. Just to be perfectly clear, the Russians kept the President waiting 20 minutes for a meeting with Putin.  Our government was notified of the Russian air strikes by a ""drop by"" by a Russian General in Baghdad.  These behaviors are not accidental:  they are meant to show the world how weak America is.

These strikes reaffirm, by military action, that the U.S. is weak, and can't back up allies.  Obama's ""soft power"" is no match for Putin's application of military force. That is the most serious lesson the world has learned from today's events.

Anwar Sadat threw the Russians out of the Middle East during the Nixon Administration, signaling that Egypt thought the U.S. was the better long term bet.  This action -- coming after Obama's misadventure in Libya and failures in Iraq and Afghanistan -- shows that the US is a bad bet for our allies and an easily-thwarted foe for our enemies.  Our next president will have to act, quickly, to reverse this reality.

Putin is again going ""nose to nose"" with President Obama. And it's Obama, again, who has blinked. This is the state we have come to, by putting amateurs in charge of our nation's security.Â

 IÂm talking about Governor Jim Gilmore from Virginia.  Gilmore volunteered to join the Army in 1971.  He completed basic training at Fort Campbell, KY and then to Ft. Huachuca, AZ to be trained as an intelligence officer.  He went there knowing that he could be sent anywhere in the world after that training and if memory serves, there were some pretty unpleasant places in the world in 1971.  Gilmore was trained at the Defense Language Institute and remains fluent in German to this day.  He was assigned to the 650th Military Intelligence Group at the boarder of East and West Germany.  Gilmore received several awards including the NATO Joint Services Commendation Medal.  He was honorably discharged in 1974 and used the GI bill to go to law school. (What a concept this time of Âgive me free college for doing nothingÂ protests).
Gilmore was the Governor of Virginia when the September 11th terrorist attacks took place.  An attack which took place, not only in New York, but in Pennsylvania and Virginia as well.  (The Pentagon is in Virginia).  He is on the national board of directors for the NRA. He is an accomplished attorney and business man, serving on the board of CACI.  He has many more credentials and I encourage you all to get to know him by going to his website at http://www.gilmoreforamerica.com/ .
All of you, as American Citizens and voters have the right to know all of your choices.  DonÂt let the media decide for you.  Decide for yourselves.  Here is a website that lists all of the declared candidates from all parties:  http://2016.presidential-candidates.org/  Their descriptions seem fairly unbias, but you should still google the candidates and go to their websites.  Look at them.  Look at all of them and look hard. 
There should be a Consumer Reports edition about presidential candidatesÂ.  Listing all of themÂ  With factual informationÂ.  Hmmmm, an idea for my next blog.  More of her blog at http://thegoodhillary.blogspot.com/2015/11/who-gets-to-choose-president.html",Call to Action,,

 -- My Four-Prong Strategy to Combat Terrorism --
Excerpts from a statement I released today:
""President Obama is dangerously wrong when he states that ISIS cannot strike a mortal blow against the United States.""
 ""The long term strategy of ISIS and the many other terrorist
organizations is to undermine the United States democracy, economy, borders, the rule of law of our democratic system, and the Western democracy itself,"" said Gilmore, who chaired a national commission that warned about a domestic terror attack before 9/11.
 ""A strike against America is a strike against our way of life,""
Gilmore, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, said. ""This they can and will do. Killing innocent civilians, and the
broadcasting of those murders is an essential action within that
strategy, and will be done as often as possible, anywhere the West is vulnerable.""
 ""As President, I will follow a four-pronged strategy, based on my
experience,"" Gilmore said. ""First I will strengthen our intelligence
capabilities, at home and world-wide to detect, capture or kill those who are persuaded to attack our country. Second, I will strengthen our domestic response capabilities, and address the American people as to the real threat, and the need for American resiliency in the face of these threats.""
 ""Third, I will rebuild America's military capability to fight this
international guerrilla war, and also to face the very real challenges we face from Chinese, Russian and Iranian military initiatives that threaten America's vital interests,"" Gilmore declared.
 ""Fourth, I will address the terrorist war strategically. I will engage
America in the ""War of Righteousness"". We must reassert American values of democracy, free enterprise, religious tolerance, justice and the rule
of law. We must denounce barbaric actions that kill innocents and
enslave women.""
""Tactics are important,"" said Gilmore, a former U.S. Army intelligence agent who served as Virginia Governor when the Pentagon was tacked on 9/11. ""But the role of a President is strategic. We in America are at war, and a long term war. The threat is real. Presidential leadership demands that we face that threat and act.""

The Israeli people use a form of behavioral profiling to determine those individuals or groups with the highest security risk. We do not currently use similar techniques in America. Instead, we treat EVERYONE as guilty of being a potential security risk.

""In this presidential campaign I bring something to the table nobody else has,Â said Gilmore, who chaired the Congressional advisory panel on terrorism. ÂIÂve been governor and at the same time I bring foreign policy experience no other candidate has.Â

Gilmore was critical of the national media and the Republican Party saying they want to winnow the presidential field rather than have voters do that.

Instead, he said he stands with the New Hampshire presidential primary and its place in the selection process.

ÂYou donÂt have to be told what to do by other people, and you donÂt have to be told who your choices are.Â Gilmore said.
